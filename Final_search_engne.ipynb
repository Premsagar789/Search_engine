talking about   i ve never gotten you into trouble  you know   you can rely on me   all information about the island is bad   i wasn t able to do much research but i talked to the hotel staff   and all of them had something bad to say about that island   the reputation of that island is mysterious   that s exactly what we need for this video blog   val  can you help me explain   all you do is lie around   i couldn t care less about that   i just want to stay chill   well that chill is a problem   because it s causing a downtrend of views to our prank vids   you know that you re not only a

payment first   this is fine   so when is the trip   it s up to you   tomorrow if you want to   but are you sure you want to visit the island   is it dangerous   yes it s dangerous especially in the afternoon   so we should leave here early morning   we should tell everyone not to go to the island   until the coast guard declares it s safe to do so   since we have ongoing search and rescue operations   the bigger problem is the bandits   so we should be extra careful   are we clear with that   yes  mayor   one more thing   how can we turn this into a good news   good news from mayor   everyone is entitled to a one week vacation   no one is allowed to set sail yet around the neighboring islands   this is good news   that s not good news   you have more family time   so how about our plan   there s nothing we can do it s prohibited   well we couldn t just cancel it   i can come up with something if you pay us more   we ll have to pay more   yes   didn t we pay 20 000 pesos yesterday   well  this is illegal we have to disobey our mayor   so we should be paid accordingly   bro   i feel destiny doesn t want us to push through   can t you see it s a sign   so you also believe in signs   for heaven s sake  don t dive into that conversation   ouch that hurts   sis  maybe abi is right   this could be a sign   silence everyone   how much   50 000 pesos no   25 000

i won t  that s extortion   aren t you adamant to do a major prank   so we can maintain the number one spot   and now you re acting stingy   you missed my point   the way they treat us is not right   and it s too much   since nica is not willing to negotiate  why don t you do it   but please make sure we don t pay 40 000 pesos today   fine  watch and learn try it  go   well  we closed a deal   what   they ve agreed   that was fast   wait  how did you do it   we still pay 40 000   why is it still 40 000   you told me not to pay 40 000 pesos  now   so i negotiated a 50  down payment today and another 50  tomorrow   don t you think i am so clever   so we leave at 4 00 am tomorrow   good night   bro   why   sorry  but i m still hesitant to do this   i thought we agreed on this yesterday   please relax   bro   i m fine with that   however  i am just worried we might screw up   we could lose our job   i told the owner we ll test drive the boat   remember  it was in the shop   you should

ll go away   yeah  welcome to hell week   we ve seen worse than a congressional budget justification lately   but yeah  not fun   sorry   how are you doing with the whole   guy i was dating getting poisoned by some nefarious agent still at large    yeah  not great  but thanks for asking   hey  do we know anything more about the arms smuggling thing   he was investigating   jim fox has submitted to a full investigation of his finances   to help the fbi and cia determine who was paying his retainer   beyond that  we re still in the dark but bending toward the happier glow   of our annual budget justification ladies and gentlemen    good morning  everyone  good morning  ma am   who s ready to take refuge in the comfort of numbers   pretty cold comfort   as you ve seen  we re looking at some major reductions this year   this year   more so than in previous years   still spreading the ample wealth   of the world s largest economy on peace and prosperity   in anticipation of the congressional belt tightening    imposed on many departments  not as much as ours   sorry  but almost a billion less for international peacekeeping efforts   how many new fighter jets is defense getting   the new congress is making efficiency its top priority   yeah  at the expense of a fully funded arms control    and international security program  jay  it s punishment   they didn t want dalton  you did and this is how they ll make us pay   before we go full conspiracy theory can we just focus   on making our case to congress   ma am  fbi director doherty is requesting a meeting   uh  tell him i ve got some time this afternoon   ma am  fbi director doherty is on his way up   fbi s hostage rescue team has been coordinating a crackdown   on human trafficking in central asia for about six months   we re just about ready to go in but kyrgyzstan isn t cooperating   that new president  nogoyev   he s not playing ball with the crackdown  i m guessing   according to him  they ve got human trafficking under control   scoffs  has he read the latest report   the child trafficking is appalling seems their police force is in on it   it s like staring into an abyss   there may be an angle that s useful   yesterday  cybercom intercepted some files in transit   originating in kyrgyzstan   we found this   i m an american   i like basketball   drawing and children   i take care of kids through my church   that s lara cramer   i barely recognize her   almost a year in captivity   this video is a sales tool for potential buyers   probably islamic radicals in syria   which means she might not be in kyrgyzstan much longer   if she hasn t been sold already   so we re hoping that president nogoyev   a guy who seems unbothered by child trafficking   will somehow be moved by one kidnapped american aid worker   he s motivated by ego   if he gets the chance to play a role in the heroic capture   of an internationally renowned victim   he may be more cooperative with the fbi   let me see what i can do   isn t nogoyev the russian lapdog   who outlawed free press on the first day   and made his mother s birthday a national holiday   well  that would totally work on my mom   nadine  they re looking for more foreign investment   we could subsidize their cotton production   invest in agricultural infrastructure   canada tried to invest in a gold mine a few years ago   they re still tied up in legal battles   this guy isn t into delayed gratification   i guess police supervision to help with rampant corruption isn t gonna do it   what about the oil pipeline through india  pakistan and afghanistan   with russia paying less for oil he might want in on that   yeah  that s  that s something   keep thinking on that   nadine   and children i take care of kids through my church   well  at least she s alive   barely  the fbi hasn t even shown it to her family yet   well  the family was threatening to sue the fbi   over not paying lara s ransom   so i m not surprised they re being careful   i remember you were a liaison to the parents during the negotiation   right  of course   i ll call them right away   the fbi couldn t pinpoint a location   there s a chance she may be gone by the time hostage rescue gets there   obviously  we don t want to get their hopes up   quietly  yeah   two vff scouts ambushed me here about 500 yards outside the compound   were they expecting you   well  it s hard to tell with the bullets flying   special surveillance group reports   increased defensive weaponry around the perimeter   they are definitely readying for something   it s time to go in and end this operation   we have to hope the element of surprise will give our team the upper hand   i don t know   they ve got a high capacity bomb they ve been stockpiling ammo   not saying it s ideal but at this point  we re out of moves   we just got to get conroy out of there alive   president nogoyev  let me be direct   the united states needs your help   this investigation into human trafficking   is a crucial undertaking between the united states   and the nations of central asia   and without your cooperation   the horror of women and children being captured and sold   into prostitution and forced labor will continue unchecked   interrupted chatter in foreign language   speaks in foreign language   woman  madam secretary what you fail to understand   is that kyrgyzstan is not like the rest of central asia  we are nomads   we take care of ourselves   speaks in foreign language   and we have never submitted to any authoritarian regimes     quietly  except for the soviet union  elizabeth  of course  mr  president   and to honor kyrgyzstan s fierce  independent spirit   we re prepared to offer you an opportunity   to strengthen your economy by joining the iap pipeline   we have deal for oil with russia we do not need your pipeline   if i may point out president nogoyev   kazakhstan   they have much trafficking not kyrgyzstan   does he think we re talking about the wrong country   we have a great deal of evidence to the contrary  mr  president   i d like also to mention a very high profile captive   who s been located within your borders   do you know chronicles of ashkenar   uh   the fantasy book series   yeah  they are the greatest   you have seen movies   with this girl  ashley whittaker   i saw the first one with my son   tonight we dream   tomorrow we slay   tomorrow s my birthday   happy birthday  mr  president   i have big party   i invite ashley whittaker   i offer her a lot of money  but   she cannot come   because a travel advisory to kyrgyzstan   i am sad   he is sad without ashley   um   clears throat   perhaps  if the president did more   to prevent sex trafficking in kyrgyzstan   young actresses might be more open to his invitations   i accept we will work on this investigation   and ashley comes   nogoyev laughs hysterically   ashley comes   tomorrow we slay   wha  what just happened   i believe we just made a deal   to convince an actress   to go to a despot s birthday party in central asia   so that we can combat human trafficking   and we thought this was just gonna be the boring budget day   hm  tomorrow we slay   oh    hello  hey  hey   that was late for a budget day   yeah  well  it turned into kind of different day    hi  hi  baby   how are you feeling   oh  pretty good i was just enjoying my dinner    jason made  uh  ooh   whispering spaghetti  spaghetti    oh  uh  oh  jace  yeah   what can you tell me about ashley whittaker  i mean   uh   blows air   potential for emma watson level credibility   coming off a ya series as confirmed by recent casting   in a coen brothers movie    he didn t even have to think about that  celebrity news  it s in the air   it s like fungus spores you breathe   and then you get giant warts on your brain  okay   nothing to do with how she looks in a space suit   chronicles of ashkenar is a future dystopia  there aren t any space suits    i knew that  see   so  why your interest in ashley whittaker   let s just say she might be able to help us avoid an actual future dystopia   hey  guys  um  do you think that this is too short    oh  my god  did you make that  that s very short   it s for the spring fling i m going full edie sedgwick   you are   so  did you get asked   i asked someone  actually  thad newton   wow  good for you  yeah    thad newton  what   senator newton s son  right um  the foreign relations committee   oh  god  do you think his mom made him say yes    there s got to be some explanation  jason  seriously   he s like some champion swimmer abercrombie model   i m just being honest about market value  i did not make the system   you know what  it s fine stay home in your layer of superiority   yeah  if only  piper asked me to go and i had to say yes    i knew she liked him  i knew that  that s great   note that i m saying nothing about how piper s clearly above your class   yeah  just like how i m saying nothing about this  dress   shut up  come on   you don t even go to westmore anymore why are you coming   uh  last i checked  there s no border security at a school dance   how old were you when you stopped fighting with your siblings   i ll let you know  am i worried about thad newton    not as worried as i am about piper  well  piper s cool  right   maybe a little too  cool  for jace   oh  come on you weren t too cool for me   once i got past your desert boots   my d  well  how about that for a boot    girl  how s the pinot  oh  baby  you heard sir ben   need to protect your voice shakespeare is very demanding   hot water and lemon   chuckles   thank you so much for taking time out of your rehearsal schedule   well  it isn t every day we get a call from the state department   we are certainly intrigued   i m sorry  can i just say a horse for tally cried my eyes out   my god  you re so sweet thank you   i might have missed that one but i m definitely a fan   yeah  as it turns out  so is president kenatbek nogoyev of kyrgyzstan   oh  how nice   we understand that he invited ashley to his birthday celebration in bishkek    ashley gets a lot of invitations  daisy  of course   we re looking to improve diplomatic relations in the region   and thought as a cultural exchange   we might be able to lift the travel advisory for the sake of a meeting   mom  that s the guy   he invited me a while ago   but i just can t associate myself with the human rights situation there   it is good to know that you re interested in human rights   because we would like to offer you   the opportunity to serve your country on an important mission   what it would involve  actually   is accepting president nogoyev s birthday invitation   and by doing that you d make it possible   for international law enforcement   to accomplish a very important mission in central asia   you keep saying  mission what s the mission   unfortunately  we wouldn t be able to share the details with you   but ashley would have full protection  of course    protection from what  is this terrorism related   again  we do need to protect the secrecy of the mission   but what we can say is ashley could be a part of a really big story   and in the meantime  you can guarantee a total media blackout   as much as that s possible   i read somewhere that a school of piranha   can digest an entire human body in seconds   you know what s faster  the internet   one image from one cell phone gets leaked   and ashley s the dumb actress who went to the dictator s birthday party   did you see what that did to hilary swank    sorry  we can t risk it   cell phone rings   oh  shoot  look there s paparazzi outside   excuse me may we use a rear exit  please    we have to get back to rehearsal  if we could just follow up   thanks so much  you guys come see the tempest   oh  we ll see the tempest   as soon as i call nadine   cell phone rings    hello  henry  it s me    ian  where are you  i m

m bringing him in   are you kidding me  you can barely walk i mean  what if it s a trap   then send backup  the silverglen mall   and tell marguerite this raid needs to happen  now   you got rope a doped by the momager    does m sec know  she s in a meeting with nadine   inducements for actors is apparently not my strong suit   i still think the president s fitness council is worth a shot   guys  this is hollywood   i mean  the best we got is a state dinner   sitting next to a hot canadian pm    you think that would work  um   hey  you re back  great   can i call nogoyev   ashley s mother had a lot of questions none of which we could answer   guys  fbi s been calling all morning i got to get kyrgyzstan on board    tell  em it s their argo  find something to do   she cares about human rights   but the mom doesn t want to put her daughter s career at risk   not to mention her life   we didn t exactly step up for lara cramer   hang on   that could be an angle we could play   you don t look as bad as i thought   you want to tell me why those guys used me for target practice   they took me off guard duty  no way to get word to you before the meet   but they think you were some dumb ass hunter  so we re still good   no  we re not  i m bringing you in   it was one screw up   i ran a tox screen you tested positive for dmt    what  it s a psychedelic compound   look  i don t know if you re taking it or they re dosing you    but  either way  you re compromised  i m fully functional    i m onto something big  one more day  the fbi is raiding the compound now    it s over  it s over  no  the elders are off site     cell phone rings  hold on  hey  mo   hey  we re at the compound    you taking any fire  they were definitely expecting us   but no casualties there s no drone and there is no bomb    are you with conroy  yeah   ask him where they put the bomb   mo  i got to call you back   what happened   henry  what the hell   baby cries   wait  you can t think   grunts   starts engine   tires screech    did your guys get ian  mo  he s in custody    but i need you to pull over right now  no  i got to get farther out   i can get you a team   breathing rapidly   lara  i like basketball and children i take care of kids through my church   how did you get this   i m sorry  that s classified   of course   can you at least tell me where she is   well  unfortunately  the file doesn t pinpoint an exact location   i can tell you only that it came out of kyrgyzstan   kyrgyzstan   kyr   see how she mentioned her church when they re about to sell her off to isis   that s my girl   how s bob thought we might see him today   his heart s not good   i m not gonna get his hopes up if we re just gonna let her slip away again   diane  uh   while you re here    i actually have a small favor to ask you   sighs   madam secretary you remember diane cramer    hello  hi  diane   diane  this is jeri whittaker and  of course  ashley whittaker   my daughter is a big fan   very nice to meet you   well  i think your daughter is just amazing   i wish she could hear you say that   i was just explaining to mrs  cramer   ashley  we hope that you ll join us on a mission   to help other girls like her daughter   so is it like a hostage situation   we can t go into too much detail   but i wanted you to meet a mother   whose daughter was taken by the criminals we re trying to stop   they can t tell us anything   i know the feeling   elizabeth security clearances are frustrating   i worked in intelligence   there were a lot of times i wanted to tell people things   that i couldn t  not even my family   but i didn t because security is a bond of trust   and i hope you know ashley  that we would protect you   with that same bond of trust   we appreciate all the effort you re going to   and i am so sorry for your daughter   she s a beautiful person who doesn t deserve what happened to her   but you understand i have to protect my girl  too   of course we understand   can i just say   part of me will never forgive these people for not paying lara s ransom   but another part knows they did what they had to   to make sure these monsters don t take someone else s daughter   i appreciate that   but baiting sex traffickers by sending in my daughter   that s how you get them they re saying they ll protect me   i want to go   i want to go   it happened just outside of groveton around 2 15 this afternoon   residents as far as rose hill said they felt the explosion   as a truck  loaded with a deadly bomb drove into a field  where it exploded   i m watching it right now what the hell happened    it was damage control  henry   i know  but i can t defend a situation where i had no choice   then you need to find a new situation   babe   can you explain to me why the ethics professor   the injured ethics professor   is the guy driving the truck with the bomb in it   believe me  if i had had any other option  i would ve taken it   are you okay   breathes deeply  i m fine   really  i mean  you didn t you didn t reinjure something   i promise i m just the same slightly lame guy that you saw this morning   the mission s not in such great shape  though   they raided the compound but we missed some key members   how s your asset   let s just say it s gonna be an interesting debrief tomorrow   the kids are here  i should go   hey  tell them no drinking not one drop  i mean it   except for you  jack ryan you should probably drink    trying to influence me  henry  i m on it  i love you  babe   will you tell him  wearing sneakers to a formal event isn t even close   to as cool as he thinks it is   i m a little more concerned about the dress    what s wrong with my dress  well  it s cold outside   dad  it s an homage to andr  courr ges   it s not gonna keep you warm  noodle just wear a sweater or something   absolutely not   master newton has arrived    hey  thad  thad  hey   come in  you look awesome   thanks  cool dress   thanks  i made it    uh  wow  um  come meet my dad    you must be thad  nice to meet you  mr  mccord    looks like you hit a tough slope  more like a tough prius  actually   how did you get here  by the way   oh  i drove it s my range rover right out front   nice  do you mind if i see your driver s license  please   sure   thanks  buddy     camera shutter click  you re all set  have a nice time   thanks   noodle  coat     cell phone text beep   mouthing   that would be piper her rideshare is here   you want her to come in so you can scan her id  you know  make sure it s    you know what  yeah  no  that s what i thought    good   chuckles   elizabeth  how s it going  is kyrgyzstan cooperating with the raids   seems like it  nothing on our screens but we heard they busted some brothels   and raided two houses in tajikistan   not exactly the massive crackdown we were hoping for   several uzbek mafia leaders are on the run   we re tracking them to the checkpoint at the border   any word on lara cramer nothing yet   in happier news  i have no idea how president nogoyev s birthday party   is going because there s zero mention of it online   20 bucks says nogoyev got an ice sculpture of himself    and watch himself melt   scoffs   it looks like they re approaching the checkpoint   matt  these are the mafia bosses  daisy  yeah  in the suvs   elizabeth  what s that    bishkek police  it looks like  matt  they re blocking the operation    mafia must have paid them off  blake  i m calling director doherty   what are they doing the police are letting them get away    unbelievable  forget doherty  i want nogoyev   daisy  uh  ma am   i don t care about his stupid birthday party   no  ma am  you ll be putting ashley at risk  we have to wait until she s gone   sighs     dance music playing  and you let him   her mom s the secretary of state what was i supposed to do   you can t take a picture of somebody s state issued id  that s  like   an invasion of your civil rights   whatever  if i was her dad i d be paranoid  too   boy  you should have shown him all those crazy texts she sent you    what s with that dress   chuckles   i know  man  like  who wears something like that   thad  it s  like  dude let me work for it   okay  so  the embassy in bishkek   promises they will either get ashley safely on a plane  or to the embassy   on a plane  please   well  for what it s worth both ngos think   the president had nothing to do with the police interference   at least not directly   let me guess  he s shocked to hear there s gambling in casablanca   they just got a house in kyrgyzstan major trafficking site   so   ma am  the house was empty looks like they got there too late   they re tracking a truck that left the site about an hour ago   they think it has the girls in it   probably too much to hope that lara s in there    where s the driver  i don t know  it s just been idling there   probably got tipped like everybody else and took off   well  at least we ll rescue whoever is inside   hi   what happened   you okay   exhales deeply   there was a  a truck   it was full of girls   they suffocated   oh  babe   that  uh   that girl   that missionary that was kidnapped last year   lara cramer   did she   yeah   groans  i have a headache from that driver s cologne   sorry you didn t get date raped   what   nothing  thad newton s a jerk   you re  you re lucky he ditched you   he didn t ditch me  i ditched him did he say something about me   wait  why did you ditch him   never mind  what did he say   nothing  just   dumb guy stuff about how much you wanted him   and something about your dress   what age do we live in   i can t ask a guy out without getting dragged to some room   wait  what   what did he do   he kept trying to get me into julia hursky s room with him   when i finally told him to stop  he  he got all mad   where do they even get these ideas   well   he said you sent him a bunch of texts or something   so  you talked to him   no  i was in the bathroom   and you said nothing    you heard mom  he s a senator s kid  no  don t even   last time i wanted to punch somebody for saying stuff about stevie    dad told me  no  well  he was wrong    he s an ethics professor  who s not a girl   i m not saying punch him but say something   guys like thad are everywhere   but guys like you are the reason they get away with it every day   daisy  was there any offer to negotiate for lara s release before she was killed   lara died along with  other victims in a tragic accident   uh  as i said there was no prior contact   daisy  this morning actress ashley whittaker tweeted   that she played a crucial part in the raid   on several brothels in kyrgyzstan   can you elaborate   ashley whittaker participated in a diplomatic exchange   as part of an agreement with president nogoyev of kyrgyzstan   will ashley whittaker be honored for her bravery   you re losing sight of the story here   the brave men and women of the fbi s hostage rescue team   delta force and several ngos liberated hundreds of victims   of human trafficking in five countries   asiya dominjon zarrin burkhanov  sholah karimov   and many other girls you ve never heard of are alive   that doesn t diminish the loss of ashley whittaker     all shouting  no   not ashley  ashley s fine  i meant lara   it doesn t diminish the loss of lara cramer   that s my statement  thanks  everybody   tell me again how you got to the mall   when i heard they were making a supply run  i volunteered   hoping we could meet   and whose truck was it    some guy named reed  you didn t think to look in the back   i just wanted to get out of there before somebody changed their mind   the two elders  abbott and slattery where are they   i don t know   they  they were talking about meeting with this doctor   um  sanders or saunders    what does this doctor do  henry  is that where they got the dmt   i don t know   when you had these visions what did you think was happening   like i said  fever  sleep deprivation   but i was able to push through that i was in control   mo  except they sent you to a shopping mall   with a bomb in the back of your truck   were you in control then  ian   no  no   they played me   and they almost   made me a suicide bomber that s on me   but  look  i know you can t trust me   but i m telling you this was just the beginning   of what   i don t know   but you have to stop it before it happens    good morning  ma am  morning  nadine   i m sorry  i didn t get through your budget memo   frankly  i m surprised i was able to write it   i think this morning we re all gonna have to compartmentalize   yes  well  um  about that   news coverage of lara cramer   may include some passionate remarks by daisy    i saw  from this morning s conference   she mentioned some of the victims by name    ma am  i m so sorry  what happened   they started circling the story about how ashley whittaker   was the real hero and i lost it   all right  we ll deal at the fallout  from that later   but where s blake   uh  he left a message he was running late   blake s running late   yes  ma am   let s try to focus   this morning s budget memo reflects some last minute changes   before our hearing this afternoon   senator mcdowell is going to be challenging   our international adoption program   matt  on what grounds   uh  his office didn t say   but we ll be ready for any and all attacks   but why   why should we have to defend a program that provides a home   for street kids in india   senator mcdowell ran his campaign on fiscal responsibility   so i m guessing that he ll challenge our program   on the grounds that it diverts funds   jay   i worked with his chief of staff he s not doing this   stop  you can t go there   why not   none of this is easy today   but we have a budget to pass   and we need to pull it together   and fight for a lot of programs that matter   jay  do they  does any of this matter   all our big meetings and political positioning   is any of it gonna save one person who shouldn t die today   we re still questioning the vff members   but i think we got something good from conroy    and you trust him  henry  i do   group leaders have been meeting with a doctor named sanders  or saunders   we looked everywhere private clinics  hospitals   it s just too big of an area too common of a name   but when forensics came back from the gear that was seized during the raid   we found this   chemical  radiological  explosives   we also ran for bio   we found trace amounts of low pathogenic avian influenza    how bad is that  so far  limited to birds   but that sent us into another direction   with the name  and we got this   henry  bill zanner  microbiologist   division of select agents and toxins of the cdc   these guys work with the worst of the worst   zanner s specialty is viral genetic mutation  specifically tracking   how lpai becomes hpai   high pathogenic avian influenza   extremely contagious  extremely deadly   he s been working in an off radar lab in oregon   until he started posting this really crazy conspiracy stuff on the web   then the cdc targeted him for investigation   he disappeared before we could even get into it   and less than a month after he had left   they d noticed some avian flu missing from his lab   now  this never happens at the cdc and it s basically impossible   unless you re someone with a high clearance   he s been off the grid ever since i think he s our guy   so we ve got key members of the vff still at large   possibly working in conjunction with the guy most qualified   to create some biological nightmare   which he may already have in his possession   girl  i m so worried about that test   um  guys  i ll see you later  okay    bye  bye    what are you doing here  no  it s just    i was just fixing something  my god  jason   come here  come here    what did you do  i was standing up for you   just like you said it s what you wanted    what is that supposed to say  what  it says  slut shamer   that s what piper called him when i told her about it  so i  you know   you realize that by calling him a slut shamer   you re saying that i m a slut   scoffs  well  you know what that s an okay thing to be   because sexuality is power which threatens the patriarchy  so   i get that piper s got you woke    but i wasn t being a slut at all  well   what the hell   run  run  run   hey  thad   diane  hi   it s nadine from the state department   hi  um   i  i just wanted to reach out   to extend our deepest condolences   for your loss of lara   diane sobs   no   indistinct chatter   there you are  i couldn t find anybody    i m so sorry i was late  no  don t worry about it   i just wanted to let you all know the good news   foreign relations committee passed the state authorization bill   in record time    that s great  yeah   that s excellent news   yeah   senator mcdowell backed down off the international adoption program   there s still gonna be a few cuts but everything s getting reduced  so   i ll work on a press release   this is a win  guys   nadine   i just got off the phone with diane cramer   that must have been hard   uh huh   could i ask you to come into my office   and then bring the team with you will you  please   elizabeth exhales deeply   we ve all seen the worst of humanity in this job   political executions   stonings  kids getting shot   so i guess i m wondering   why this is the one that s doing us in   ma am  i ve not been myself   i apologize about the press conference   stop  i m not calling anybody out or taking anybody to task   i m  i m really asking   well   i ll say it  those reporters were right   they thought we blew it and we did   you saw those suvs disappear into the shadows   and they got away with it and we just watched   i get that  i  i really do  but   blake  i make binders about clean water   and global food shortages   and i track phone calls   and i stay five steps ahead of a very busy person   and when people ask what i do   i say i m saving the world one binder at a time   but  i don t know maybe i m just making binders   nadine  it s the abyss   we can dance around it   we can call it something else and pretend it s not there   but it is there   look  when you came here   you broke a lot of rules   and things got done   and now  to go back to bureaucracy   and budget cuts while stuff like that happens   i want to slay dragons  ma am   not play whack a mole with evil   sometimes making evil have to duck and find another hole   is the best we re gonna do   somebody sent me this after one of the terrorist attacks   it s a poem   called  good bones  by maggie smith   the last part of it goes   life is short and the world is at least half terrible   and for every kind stranger there is one who would break you   though i keep this from my children   i am trying to sell them the world   any decent realtor walking you through a real hellhole   chirps on about good bones   this place could be beautiful  right   you could make this place beautiful     jason  then thad goes but i m a dude  i can t be a slut   did you get piper to explain it to him   jason doesn t need piper tell him what you said   uh  it might have been something like  uh   your objectification of femininity has an expiration date  pal   and that date might be today   well  at least you gave yourself an out   and then he goes to wipe it off and the paint is damaged   you should have seen his face it was like i cut samson s hair   he was like  he was like   oh  my god what am i gonna tell my dad   and then dean ward shows up and goes you re trespassing on school grounds   we re gonna fill out a police report for damaged property   this is getting a bit less funny   wait  but then she gets us inside   and we lay out  like the whole thing to her  and  um   she kind of  like  she went  like how did she do it   well  thaddeus newton had it coming to him   better that it happened sooner rather than later    yes  total pass  she did not   jason  i don t know what got into dean ward  it was an absolute moment of glory   please rate this subtitle at www osdb link aht4h

1:  in the name of god the most gracious the most merciful from muhammad the messenger of god to heraclius the emperor of byzantium greetings to him who is the follower of righteous guidance i bid you to hear the divine call i am the messenger of god to the people accept islam for your salvation he speaks of a new prophet in arabia was it like this when john the baptist came to king herod out of the desert crying about salvation to muqawqis patriarch of alexandria kisra emperor of persia muhammad calls you with the call of god accept islam for your salvation embrace islam you come out of the desert smelling of camel and goat to tell persia where he should kneel muhammad messenger of god who gave him this authority god sent muhammad as a mercy to mankind the scholars and historians of islam the university of al azhar in cairo the high islamic congress of the shiat in lebanon the makers of this film honour the islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message therefore the person of mohammad will not be shown 600 years after christ died when europe was sunk in the dark ages and everywhere the old civilizations were falling muhammad was born in mecca in arabia mecca was then a rich trading city ruled by its merchants whose wealth was multiplied by a unique privilege they housed the gods every year at the time of the great fair the desert priests brought their idols and the images of their gods into the custody of the kaaba once the most holy shrine of abraham the kaaba had now become a house of idolotry hosting no fewer than 360 different gods mecca in 610 a d bilal have you had today s count umaya not yet but this year the gods are gold when you put the gods and prophet together you sit very pretty between hmm and more gods to place in the kaaba caravan from syria hmm they must have been running they ll be thirsty put five more men on north wells how many sheep shall i have to kill for them 70 give them a hundred mecca must keep her name for hospitality and ten lambs for the leaders bread and water do the poets have in the hakim s house where verse and prose are nightly put to slaughter and and the bread i swear in there is thinner than the water oh open the space open the space you lovers of poetry to abu sufian willing and which patron of the arts when abu sofyan invites the poet in their joy is kit and love is kin where wines and cakes abound the skills of abu sofyan all revels and all songs begin when abu sofyan invites the poet in from the silkworms of china my lady a pleasure to the limb and as my lady can see a ravish to the eye yes 7 lengths 20 dinars abu sofyan s wife 15 oh gold the gods of the kaaba have their needs their upkeeps who is that man who stood there who looked into my soul carry me away from here why must muhammad come down here why don t you stop him he is your nephew maybe he will change change he is 40 years old it s unnatural with a rich wife he could afford the best of mecca yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave it is unnatural for a man who dares to risk the anger of al uzza who keeps our health manat the god of our prosperity allat the god of our family and tribes and hubal hubal who starts our caravans and predicts our fate to challenge the gods within earshot of the gods is dangerous unreasonable rebellious blasphemous yes i m afraid muhammad will harm himself i am always sad when the great fair is over i might not see the next one abu talib abu talib catch your breath zaid has muhammad come down from mount hira yet he s been up there three days no no i haven t seen him khadijah hoped he might have come to you on his way home then he s still up there three days i m afraid for him on the mountain because i don t know what it means men see the world too well from a mountain muhammad read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read he s still trembling under the blanket but he has spoken zaid what happened to my nephew on the mountain he was alone in the cave suddenly an angel came in to him the angel said read muhammad replied i can not read the angel commanded again read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read who knows if it was gabriel it could have been a dream when muhammad was coming from the mountain he saw gabriel plainly in the shape of a man standing on the horizon wherever he looked upon every turn of his head he saw him and gabriel said to him again i am gabriel and you muhammad are the messenger of god who has he told about this his wife and ali and his friend abu bakr and you i am his adopted son be careful to whom you talk tell him his uncle who protected him when he was a child will protect him still after all they say the god of moses spoke to him out of a burning bush if you do not restrain your nephew then we will he s dividing the city heart against house he s dividing the generations child against parent the young are listening to him he attracts the young we are arabs we obey our fathers our children cannot be our teachers how can we accept that the man we met in the street yesterday can be some god s prophet today dead bones can live again he says because he who created man can also make man return from the dead he says the gods might leave us and give their benefits to another city tell him we will give him authority position and keys to the kaaba and money what money he wants tell him we will give him anything he wants muhammad spare yourself and me do not put a greater burden on an old man that he can bear in your childhood you were in my arms i cannot now see you hurt if you refuse them they will hurt you he said this to me were they to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left i would not renounce my message which is from god when i am dead you may do as you please but whilst i m alive you will obey your father why did you hurt our father if i were drunk every day and played dice every night you d call it high spirits you will be more my brother than you are now you are all my children i ve given you everything i could but it seems not to be enough muhammad gives me more he give all the world more get him out of here father it s not waleed or me it s our father you tortured him wait hudayfa wait how can they say it s an invention musab when it isn t new in mecca it s new yet god has said it all before to noah moses jesus to all the prophets but people changed it turned it forgot it now god said it to muhammad again and it is new again what is it it s jafar what have you brought with you the very word of god when the sun is overthrown when the stars fall when the mountains vanish when the camels big with young are abandoned when the wild beasts are herded together when the seas rise when the souls are sorted when the female infant who is buried alive asks for what crime she was killed when the books are opened when the sky is torn away then every soul will know what it has done were you there jafar when god gave him these words dawn is coming up ammar you first then you jaafar ammar you kept your mother awake all night with worry i m sorry father where were you have you been with muhammad again what will happen now forgive him it was my fault i did it that god has helped us all our lives but it fell it could not even help itself what talk have you been listening to the real god is unseen he s not made of clay ammar we see the gods in the kaaba every day i m afraid for you you re listening to people who will hurt you i m listening to muhammad mother muhammad is generous yes he gives he shares he ll pass no man without a smile but he is spreading dangerous ideas dangerous ideas that no man should start that the rich should not afloat the poor the strong should not oppress the weak are these dangerous ideas girls should not be forced into marriage but be able to choose or refuse by only tonight he said stop the burial of new born girls i was fortunate always fortunate with your mother yes but you know that you and i nearly never met yasser and you were nearly never born i was to be buried like my two sisters but my father couldn t do it he couldn t do it the third time when the second girl was being when my father was putting sand over her she took hold of his finger the way a baby does he told my mother afterwards that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased and he dared take away his hand when i was born my father ran out of the house screaming that he couldn t do it again that he could never do it again sumayyah it is the custom but it s wrong the gods that let such things be are no gods i promised to go to muhammad s house mama we pray there yes he is a good man yes yes you go two men are following him read muhammad can neither write nor read but he can speak what did you say he can speak well so can you so now you speak up young man what does muhammad say umm they are god s words not his which god s what words a speaking god your muhammad speaks only to himself when god reveals his message to muhammad he remembers every word then he tells it to those who can write this is the quran muhammad has starved himself into dreams he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut his eyes are shut but his heart is open you kick him for his cleverness there is no purpose in that doesn t muhammad realize we live by giving housing to the gods we own the kaaba every year the tribes of arabia come here to mecca to pray and to buy from us now were we to replace 300 gods with just one whom we cannot even see who is supposed to be in taif and medina here in my house in jerusalem on the moon where would mecca be then the gods are both our worship and our revenue you cannot buy and sell god young man you are close to the whip ammar be sensible boy i have a question muhammad teaches you a slave is equal to his master this black bilal who i paid money for equal to me yes muhammad says before god all men are as equal as the teeth of a comb this is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars it gives them pretensions bilal teach this man the difference between the lord of mecca and a slave take that whip lash his face to teach his mouth a lesson whip him whip him cut him whip him do it bilal obey them they will kill you see what anarchy they bring they ve even infected our slaves if you re human enough to have gods remember they are the gods of your owner i bought your humanity bilal when i bought you you will be corrected one one god there is only one god who is stronger now your master or this one god of yours one god there is only one god bring the stones one god one one god crush him break him have you finished with him there is only one god one god you could swear the slave was preaching one god lord umaya abu bakr will pay a dinars for this slave wait now it s against our social order to sell a slave during his correction the offer is to lord umaya 200 if the price of slaves is raised we shall have to bail ourselves next year take him he is no use to me anymore kill him or take him i m finished with him we are declaring ourselves god has told his messenger to declare islam to all men open the windows let the world hear we are coming out of the darkness hear well the word of god hear well the messenger of god there are no other gods but god and muhammad is his messenger there are no other gods but god and muhammad is his messenger we have come into light join us in the march to the kaaba god is most great god is most great god has no partner we have come into light join us in the march to the kaaba muhammad and his rebellion called islam are coming out to foul our gods and dethrone religion don t let them reach the kaaba throw them back defend your gods there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger

messenger of god guards god is great this is blasphemy you idiot god is great god is great god is great there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god now s the time to break them there are only 30 of them no we ve done enough more will only create sympathy for them god is great stand down god is great god is great in the name of god most gracious most merciful say o you who reject faith i worship not what you worship keep him out of the kaaba i worship not what you worship keep him out of the kaaba lead them out neither do you worship what i worship lead them out neither do you worship what i worship silence you re a false prophet neither do you worship what i worship silence you re a false prophet finish muhammad protect the prophet finish muhammad protect the prophet messenger of god back to the corner hamza hamza you are brave he is the bravest man in the desert when he meets unarmed men muhammad is is a liar liar if you don t let him speak where s the lie and where s the truth when it hasn t been spoken yet muhammad is a fraud stand up hit me back if you dare i affirm my nephew s religion and i say what he says whoever has the courage to fight fight with me muhammad when i hunt the desert at night i know god is not kept in a house who would have thought that hamza hamza above all with his wine drinking lion hunting would come to join muhammad the more we attack him more they seem to join him where does he find his words i don t know how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain and come down three days later blazing with poetry if it were just poetry he says it s god how do we fight someone whose strength we do not understand muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies so naturally he s found an audience then we must make that audience less eager to listen to him we will begin with the weaker ones your turn have mercy stretch her who is your god answer me say it say hubal is your god say it there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god oh my god ammar your father and mother are the first martyrs of islam you are promised paradise how much are you men prepared to suffer the prophet has said we must leave mecca if you stay they will kill you one by one muhammad says that in abyssinia there is a christian king no man is wronged in his country we must leave now today uthman god be praised let us go we found their tracks and followed them but they just disappeared they were there in the desert under the vultures and you let them escape you escape they vanished if muhammad has stayed then only the weakest have gone weak or strong they ll blacken our name we re honest merchants we buy and sell in good faith we cannot afford scandal abyssinia amr you are a friend of annajashi the king yes can you use that friendship i think i can bring them back yes abyssinia rise up amr please nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one god only wait when we take this pledge we expel ourselves from the rest of arabia so wait war is in this pledge we are to make enemies of brothers we are to make firewood of our gods that is the meaning of the pledge if we take it there can be no turning back for muhammad is indeed the messenger of god foretold to us by the jews in our city so if anyone has doubt in this pledge go now and if you have no doubts then you do as i do i pledge myself to the one and only god and to you muhammad the messenger of god he is of us and we are of him let him bring his followers our brothers to us to medina sync corrections by pocong ltti this was a journey that changed the world the hijra or flight to medina only 70 people split up into small groups walking 250 miles of desert yet so profound were the consequences so lasting were the effects of this walk that from it the muslims date their calendar in this moment islam found it s future muhammad himself stayed in mecca in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely muhammad has become a nation he has received a city entering into pledges and treaties and you salool who claim to be king of medina lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed you should worry about yourself abu sufian every time you trade a whiff of perfume out the city you must creep past that man in medina he is across your mercantile throat so to speak and what do you intend to do l intend to wait and how long will you wait till you and the rest of arabia remove him to save your way of life and while you wait i should accept his call of course does he think i will give him my birthright i will not medina is worth the conversion hypocrisy of course it s a healthy hypocrisy king salool wiping his face on the floor 5 times a day praying i don t believe you he may not have to we ll do know what we should have done before kill muhammad come come and see they say that practice leads to perfection 7 young men each from a different family my own son ikrima is with them they will stab him together if the responsibility for his death is shared where lies the guilt my idea i m not sure i m part of it muhammad s body contains too much his mind his words but it is an ingenious solution and a final one no ali his cousin laid there to die for him who are we fighting they cannot go far\n","CHUNK 2:  all the tracks are watched he must take to the desert bakkah will give 100 camels to the man who brings back muhammad or his head look for 3 of them muhammad abu bakr and uriqat his bedouin guide what is it they re not grazing camel maybe two days that from the city why are you here medina is to the north they make the tracks not i nomads travelling west i know my art they say that you can track a bird by smelling the air we go with them he may be in that cave over there muhammad if you come out we will take you to mecca alive muhammad come out they can t be in there this this web is unbroken and these pigeons they would not build we were wrong to follow them we should have gone north let s move then we still have time to head them off a few threads of a spider s web were all that was then between muhammad and murder but he was a man not to be killed the bedouin guide led him and his companion abu bakr in their escape through untracked spaces of the desert and the heat of the june days at medina his followers waited with their welcome ready but in great fear for his journey anything no nothing he himself says he is only a man no man can survive that heat there i see them look run and hide i may be obliged to free you as a gesture welcome to the city of medina the blessed your city messenger of god you will stay with me messenger of god i have the best house in medina you will give me the honor of keeping you stay with me please please please how can the prophet choose between so many welcomes where god guides his camel to stop there he will build his house all agreed we turn quaswa his camel loose and where quaswa sits the prophet stays clever man a choice made by a camel can offend no one here we will build the house of the prophet and our first meeting place a prayer house the first mosque of islam here god is great god is great what is the prophet of god doing carrying bricks give me that look you are doing too much please go and sit down we ll do it look he went for more work is a worship he says he s 53 years old how old are you there is something missing maybe a bell to call the people in the christians use a bell mmm yes what about a horn like the jews a drum there s too much blood in a drum why not the human voice as in umar ibn khattab s vision the prophet agrees he means you bilal me you have a good voice use it climb up there brothers today a man of medina will embrace a man of mecca each will share half and half reach out embrace your neighbor and brother i m tired of the politics of kissing slaves read this the prophet should concern himself with the after world how is my son praying like a horse does it burn your hands if it s not torn up it will burn down the house he s making laws like a king he has declared that loyalty to islam is more than loyalty to tribal family what all muslims are next of kin to one another don t be mislead by that they must change the nature of the tribes before that the danger is here equality a man s neighbour is as good as himself the lunatic means it jews and christians have equal rights with muslims the jews who attach themselves to a common wealth shall be protected women have rights of inheritance rights next he ll be giving the camel rights he has the lunatic has you can t overload them he s remaking a city my city damn him he s taken our sons from us our future from us his rights are wrongs no more this time it will not be just his riffraff we will take everything of value they have left in mecca their rugs their houses their silver and with it a large of caravan to damascus my friends listen to me i have news from mecca everything you have left behind is gone the thieves abu bakr s shops the prophet s house sold every cup or piece of cloth every rag or bone you ever owned is thrown on the market you are a people of nothing don t you even fight for what you own who talks of the fight what other way is there hamza when the prophet says fight we fight now he says peace exactly you are a peace loving people up to your necks and fore bearers go back to work we have to defend ourselves you are the messenger of god yet they mock abuse and plunder us and we do nothing in the package of war we are pathetic but they are led by greed we are led by god and you now i i know how you hate the sword but we have to fight they have stolen our property they are taking it to damascus right past our own door i say by god get back i m sorry i m carried away it s the pounding in my head please fight them but look at the sun it s not the time for prayer it is newly revealed by god to his messenger fight but fight in the way of god against those who fight against you drive them out of the places where they drove you out for persecution is worse than slaughter

horsemen yes i have i don t like them he s sending out archers to watch them no matter what happens the archers must hold off those horsemen zaid tell the prophet we are ready what do you think hamza well they outnumber us so i d say it s a fair fight we see them and they see us what faces me has never frightened me all praise be to hubal hubal when muhammad gives the word we will go to them hamza

the loot stand where you are told to stand come back to your positions all of you come back it s a road our centre is gone we ve lost the battle khalid not yet hold on where is the prophet muhammad is dead i saw him fall no no he s alive find him back back to the mountains halt i thought we were beaten now victory is yours khalid we have no victory until we have finished muhammad he is up in those rocks we have finished our business we have avenged badr but we can end him and islam forever some of his fanatics are still with him they have the advantage of the mountains the risk is too high muhammad listen a day for a day the day of uhub for the day of badr our dead have answered to your dead our dead are in paradise your dead are in hell fire hamza hamza do you hear me hamza do you know that i am with you i hind do you remember anything hamza how you killed my father and my brother now you too are dead my heart is light do you hear hamza light but i haven t finished with you death is too small wahshi cut him open cut him they lost a battle and what do they do they come home and dig the ground harder they re mad i agree with you they defy reason they are even happy they lost god sent their defeat they say to try them in their faith oh yes they are fighting with the sky they ll get what they want they want mecca they ll get mecca when we see the stars at noon don t underestimate them i ve learned that to my cost my friend mecca is more than their home it s where god spoke to man mecca is like a homesickness to the soul this year they re going as pilgrims what unarmed unarmed abu sofyan will slaughter them in the desert if you believe in god as they do it might be possible not to get slaughtered but i agree with you they probably will be be still do not let them provoke you that is what they want stand firm peace be to you the prophet says all who love god must renew their oaths to him under the tree they ve sent someone else it s suheil that means we might come to an agreement muhammad you have been given conditions of truce between yourself and mecca have you agreed to them yet what is this in the name of god the most gracious who is this new god they call gracious i do not know him strike him out and i cannot agree with this muhammad the messenger of god if i have thought you were the messenger of god i would not have fought you make it muhammad the son of abdullah agrees with suhayl the son of amr that is more factual well so i understand good that is better now it is agreed that you do not continue your pilgrimage you must turn around and go home mecca is home however you may continue your pilgrimage next year and for 3 days only in and out we also agree to the truce for 10 years during that time you will not attack any tribe or ambush any caravan or any individual associated with us and vice versa if you injure any one of us the truce ends and vice versa is that clear ten years ten years of peace we need that time we will use that time these letters from muhammad messenger of god to the rulers of the world call the world to islam to heraclius emperor of byzantium kisra emperor of persia muqawqis patriarch of alexandria god go with you god is great god is great god is great there are no different races in islam an arab is not superior to a foreigner nor a white man superior to a black all return equally to god unless you desire for your neighbour what you desire for yourself you don t have faith a man goes to bed with his belly full while his neighbor is hungry he isn t a muslim the ink of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr a man reading is handsome in the sight of god so learn to read and when you have learned teach the people of the book the jews with their bible the christians with their testament must be respected by you for their books likewise came from god you must not think of muhammad as more than a man he was collecting firewood one day let me do it i said why he said you are the prophet of god you can t go around scratching for firewood but he looked at me mumbling god does not like the man who considers himself above other men he said so i laid back and watched him suddenly he stopped he stood to his full height and came to me yes i am the prophet of god he said but even i do not know what will become of me amr have you come to take me again no i have come to ask you to take me i witness that there is only one god and that muhammad is his messenger may god forgive me the times i have fought against you islam does away with all that went before it i m sorry i came in here wearing here are my jewels what they are worth i give to the poor and may i offer you my yes but you were the bitterest sword against islam now by the will of god i will be the raised sword of god ah its all easy to god just as he makes dying living he can make losing winning two years ago we thought we were beaten when we had to sign that truce look at us now charging from victory to victory in the hearts of men what s that abu sofyan is coming abu sofyan why am i insulted like this i m abu sofyan i expect some courtesy we are not at war we have a truce i have come to speak to muhammad where is he he is in the mosque muhammad we did not break the truce i have come to reaffirm the truce i speak for mecca muhammad why do you turn from me don t go muhammad don t go bedouins broke the truce not us the night was dark i am here to testify the night was dark barra barra this is your city hudayfa you are my kin aim to see for me i must be heard i am mecca i am the leader of mecca why am i insulted like this because you keep no promise and respect no pledge i have heard what i never thought i d hear abu sofyan asking for pity to be outfought outfought outmaneuvered by a one time shepherd you saw that shepherd s religion grow from a speck speck was in my eye i could see nothing tell mecca their gods are dead it is useless to resist god travel fast or every man here will be close behind you it s you who have broken the truce for tonight will be ten thousand men from every tribe now we can fight them you are back we will close the streets and defend from the houses it s no use there are thousands of them every hour they are joined by more you coward hind go home you coward are you the leader of mecca look at yourself you are broke they swallowed you and spat you back did my father and brother die for my husband to run away you go home you we can not resist mecca is taken no no we are to camp here for the night i can see mecca even through the mountains so many fires i cannot count them it s very beautiful when we drove them out of mecca i did not know they carried mecca with them we can smell the bread they re baking yes it means they don t intend to plunder at least i hope that s what it means they don t want blood on their own walls and doorsteps i can bargain with that take me to him so you are giving us the city you offer me no bread i understand you may decide to kill me say what you have come to say i saw your fires the men around them and i know what power you put into your men we can no longer resist muhammad now if you ll agree you dare to come here and ask for conditions isn t it time yet for you to recognize who muhammad is muhammad there is still doubt in my heart if i were to cut off your head it would remove all your doubts khalid there s no compulsion in religion a man may take many years or only need minutes it s god who decides the time so respect his doubts you re a black slave you are the best school i am only what god has given me yes the gods that i worshipped they don t have any use it would have helped me i declare under no compulsion there is one god and you are the messenger of god now let me go get inside no doors may be broken down nothing plundered nothing seized no one abused all behind closed doors are safe all in abu sofyan s house are safe all by the kaaba are safe at least he kept his word they haven t forced a door he s stolen hearts not walls it s a permanent victory i dread going out we must we must at the end were we so wrong the way we lived yes that was wrong we were trapped in our own faults our gods were less than us now there he is making his entrance to the kaaba in the name of god most gracious most merciful god gave this house to abraham to be a sacred place worship no other gods but him and cleanse his house so it was muhammad took no revenge and allowed none he declared mecca a holy place no one may shed blood or cut down a tree or kill a living thing in mecca soon all arabia was converted not only to the new worship but to the new laws manners attitudes contained in islam the prophet had lived to see his work done but now he began to feel the nearness of death one great act of his prophethood remained the setting of it s seal he called the people to him and he spoke for the last time his message of surrender to god and humanity to man oh mankind listen well i may not be with you much longer the weak among you feed them on what you eat dress them as you are dressed you will meet your god and he will call you to account for your actions let those who are present warn those who are absent you are all are descendant from adam and the best among you is he who most regards god think deeply about what i say let all your feuds be abolished you must know that every muslim is the brother of every other muslim and all muslims are brothers one of another between muslims there are no races and no tribes nor must you take anything from your brother except what is given freely do not oppress and do not be oppressed o my people i am but a man it may be that the angel of death will visit me soon and death will overtake me but i have left you a book revealed by god the quran which is light and guidance now he repeated to the people the final revelation of the quran the seal and termination not muhammad s words but god s word this day i have perfected your religion for you and completed my favour to you and i ve chosen for you islam as your religion on june the 8th 632 in his 63rd year muhammad died many of his followers could not believe the fact how can such a man die but abu bakr the prophet s friend stood up in the mosque if anyone worships muhammad let him know that muhammad is dead but he who worships god let him know that god is alive and can not die they buried muhammad beside his mosque in medina but the religion he preached found it s place in the heart of man it endured it multiplied still to mecca they come mankind the people of islam dressed in their pilgrim white all equal before god all united in this place of prayer each individual soul joined in a community of worship one god synced by jisin\n"]}],"source":["for i, chunk in enumerate(df['chunks'][0]):\n","    print(f\"CHUNK {i+1}: \", chunk

yoshiko sakuma tetsuro tamba directed by kinji fukasaku special joint investigation meeting hey here they come chief what was the meeting about what are you investigating is tatsumura involved there are rumors that sanritsu industries is behind all this isn t its president tatsumura the mastermind behind this incident aren t you flooded with complaints about police ineffectiveness in the case they say the authorities are too cautious or worse weak kneed i ll ask you the same question what do you guys think it s easy to criticize others but are you trying to bring back the old heavy handed police power it s not as if cautious investigation is bad and that s part of the difficulty of this job it s not you who s been getting your men killed at every turn it s me oh hi the press yeah i got a little excited i went to the farewell ceremony for detective sugiyama i see well that s three in a row what a shame yeah and the meeting it s like we ve hit a dead end we don t have a concrete plan all the violent incidents in this neighborhood are connected to sanritsu industries i m sure i m on the right track but i don t know where to start to catch them by the tail we don t have a single clue we re helpless it s our own fault that the city is calling us weak kneed the three men who died would turn in their graves sanritsu industries business information chairman saichi sakura president j go tatsumura i just had an idea i heard a rumor on the street tatsumura has recently taken complete control of the organization they say things are getting awkward with his uncle sakura mmm hmm so if we can crack the organization by successfully exploiting this opportunity we might be able to get some clues for the investigation i see but that would require of course we can t do it alone we really need the help of a man knowledgeable about the organization mmm hmm a kind of guerrilla operation interesting idea but i don t know if there s anybody who could be that useful i actually have a little bit of an idea about that oh who is it tojima brothers hello hello coming oh old man hi hi welcome are you two working together no she wouldn t stop asking me to show her how to fix it boy you look terrible oh did you have the ceremony yet no not yet it seems rather silly to call it a wedding now but we ll invite you when we do mr ogata sure please come in okay it looks like two more cars have been added after not coming here for a while but the two drivers are unavailable so they re just like decorations now please have a seat okay hard working kind hearted she ll make a good wife yeah i suppose so so what brought you here today well it s kind of hard to say what i m asking you to do actually i just wanted to ask you to go back to the old you the old me yes a yakuza old man don t joke around with me i wouldn t joke about asking you to do this please i really need your help what s the story you want me to be a g man you re no stranger to tatsumura i would like to ask you to do this and let me assure you this isn t about saving the face of the police or anything we have to crush that germ like organization as soon as possible old man if you want to talk about that please take it up with someone else i m asking because i know i can count on you it s not a job that just anybody can do don t give me too much credit i m not that respectable but first of all i don t want to do anything that ll open old wounds okay maybe i shouldn t have asked you to do it why don t you get out of this business i d be happy to help you find a job it would be my pleasure but i m a man with no education at all living only for this job since i was a simple police officer the grime sticks and doesn t seem to come off i might have to die to get it clean i m sorry i can t help you it s okay i ll definitely attend your wedding yeah bye oh is mr ogata going home already yes oh what was that about it has nothing to do with us yes this is tojima transport co huh what s up it s the usual hello how s it going are you ready to accept our protection i refuse i don t want to be under your care think carefully about it without a driver there wouldn t be any business you know what what did he say this time don t worry about it huh the car s back oof brother osamu osamu what s wrong he said he got jumped by thugs thugs yeah let s go inside to treat the wound yes so when did you get out today i was on my way here i was surprised to see that the truck was marked tojima transport boss i m quitting no matter how many lives i have it won t be enough what are you saying the two guys taking a break must have gone through the same thing i did you can t tell us to fight the yakuza let s do it bro i can help you to be honest i m disappointed that you quit the business osamu what

in you bro where s the brother that i used to know i m sure he wouldn t just sit back and let this happen to him idiot damn it you re not my brother osamu don t talk to your brother like that take care of yourself thank you but you know don t you think it s frustrating when you re provoked like that it s frustrating but we ll be out of business if we take on every fight we re not selling fights but you were the boss s daughter you should understand how i feel i ve forgotten you know the old days both your brother and i suit yourself no wonder my brother became a coward his wife s too beautiful and too decent sassy little thing aren t you you should look before you say something weird tojima brothers you see this business belongs to you and your brother damn it my brother he your

came i told em to look people in the eye when talking and threw em out and here we are today you didn t report it to the police did you yeah i thought about that but if the cops are there all day long no customers will come they predicted that much all right do you know which group the thugs belonged to they belong to the takeda family down the street i think sanritsu industries is the mastermind behind the protection racket i heard that the takeda family s boss became a shareholder of sanritsu industries the other day i think that s fishy i didn t know that a champion huh well i m past my prime if i m remembering the old days welcome back oh what happened to your car uh what happened to the drivers well did they all quit yes but that s okay hire someone new again maybe i should learn to drive what about tomorrow s work i turned it down earlier i m sure it s not a good time come on tonight is osamu s welcome home party it s going to be at my apartment osamu what s wrong i showed those guys from the takeda family how strong i got in juvie idiot what would you do if something happened to you worry more about yourself than you do about me osamu what happened ouch captain fujikawa was happy that you agreed we ll help as much as we can but this work is informal yes so it s strange when i m the one asking you to do this but you take good care of yourself and old man you needn t worry about that i m willing to do it even if no one asks me to do it well i feel better now that you put it that way and what about your subordinates i want to work in my own way so i m going

you re still willing to take it on please don t hesitate to tell me when you say subcontracting for the police how will you start first i ll pretend to make a comeback to the yakuza then i ll infiltrate their organization under the guise of a turf war that would mean we re the tojima family gentlemen this is the perfect role for you if you look in the mirror i think you ll see what i mean i don t want to flatter you but i d hardly call you all good citizens but it takes a hell of a lot of guts and horsepower to hit them you re all perfect team members in that regard hey bro even though it s police work we re putting our lives on the line there will be a little reward won t there i can t guarantee that i m sure you ll manage it just fine but don t forget there s a policeman next to you so let s hear your answer can you guys give me a hand let s show them what we can do i ll get tatsumura back for his protection racket how about you matsushima well i m being asked to take care of the car i don t see anyone else qualified goro i ll do my best to save the extra money mr policeman it s my duty so i ll do whatever you scared me osamu brother don t treat me like a stranger everyone i m his brother osamu kaji we re actually half siblings how many times have i told you i m not gonna make you one of us again with that i wish you d trust me but a goofball like you would be the first to get hit i can t take care of a guy like that well then brother you mean you can t you d be slowing me down give it up fine then i ll do my own thing osamu osamu he s just like you the way he won t back out of something once he s said it he s a real pain in the ass so everything is okay then right okay now let s get to work first you ll go out and spread word that i m making a comeback tojima brothers that man by pistol that man by tommy gun that man by dynamite everybody everybody disappears in a puff of smoke with water when the blood left on the bed dries up there i hear it that rhythm sing it dance all you want jam session on an enchanting night i m drunk and i m all alone may i sit here if you don t mind me sitting with you would you like to buy me a drink in return you tell me whose territory this is you sure aren t tight lipped are you i ll have what he s having i hear a retired yakuza named tojima is making a comeback well i m sure there will be an uproar now i don t think tatsumura will allow it but tojima and tatsumura must have been like brothers people only think that s true they don t get along with each other very well i m telling you this for your own good if you want to make a living as a yakuza it s smarter to join tatsumura thanks for the advice if you want i can ask the higher ups for you did tatsumura ask you to scout for the yakuza huh you ll have to ask tatsumura if you can hire a guy named tojima then you re next time you see me call me tojima recreation center construction who are you you almost got yourself killed do you know what s going on here i do but thanks anyway don t get me wrong i m here to kill you don t move do you recognize this face five years ago five years ago in a turf war on the beach you shot a guy named kuroki then you re kuroki s i m his younger brother now that you remember i m going to kill you wait that wasn t supposed to be a fatal injury no respectable doctor would ve treated that wound it s no wonder it was fatal i made a vow then i swore i d kill you if i ever saw you are you hurt you think you saved me that doesn t make up for my brother wait a minute i get how you feel but i ve got a job i ve got to do i won t let you stop me boss are you hurt i m fine the advertisement worked 100 i ve already got a lot of sponsors that s the guy him a debt is a debt i ll wait until your job is done in exchange i m not leaving your side for a while i won t let you die until it s by my hand so you re a bodyguard well okay he s an old friend of mine try to get along starting tomorrow we re going to be busy sanritsu industries boss tojima is here what do you want to do i thought they d be here by now hey to what do we owe this surprise it s been a while how s your shipping company doing i heard you were happy together with the previous boss s daughter i don t think i can make a living as an honest man i m going back to the old tojima i see that s why you came all the way out here to say hello shimadzu let s celebrate tojima s comeback book a welcome home party you already threw me a welcome home party a fancy one with lead bullets i know it was supposed to be a fireworks show but it was very much your style tojima you ve become nastier living as an honest man i m not as bad as you you took over this building in less than four years i was hoping you d tell me how to make money that s the kind of advice one can only get from a professional i wish you d stop with the innuendos sanritsu industries is a legitimate company and we pay our taxes if you want you can go ask the tax office but i hear there s a lot of money to be made without the tax office knowing what do you mean for example protection rackets that sort of work fits these guys don t move what s this a raccoon dog s tail i m the one who built all this i have some allies but also many enemies you can never be too careful everyone leave us i think it s time to cut to the chase i m being extorted it seems no i just need a little help it s a lot of work to make up for four years of absence i d like to borrow your territory for a while for old time s sake sorry i don t have anything like that right now i have enough to eat running a theater and a recreation center oh yeah that s a relief then i ll make my own territory without reservation that s all well and good but be careful they say once a boxer retires he never makes a comeback again jinxes can be broken someday you know well look forward to it i see tojima has shown up so now tatsumura has more things to worry about that s why he tried to get rid of him last night that was a screw up out of character for tatsumura i m getting lucky it s good to live a long time you ve pit the two against each other for your own advantage i m the one who originally created sanritsu industries after all i didn t want to keep it in tatsumura s care forever so shall we propose the election of a new president at the next general meeting no i think we ll wait and see what tojima does chairman hmm mr tojima has come to say hello to you good thing he came now have him come over here mr chairman it s been a while yeah a while i hear you made a comeback the other day yeah i ll need your help again yeah sure but now i m practically retired but i heard a rumor that you ll be returning as president of sanritsu once again there are too many irresponsible rumors out there i agree i was even gossiping with tatsumura just now with tatsumura they say you had a dispute last night that s just another irresponsible rumor but you better be careful it s weird saying this to your face i ve always preferred you to tatsumura if you ever need help i m always here for you oh i ll see you then well i ll leave you alone for today this is a fine house for an old fox s nest and they re even planning to expand the place sanritsu industries i see that old man and tojima huh i think we can still do something about it now you re something yourself too what are you after the sakura family s territory well if that s on the table okay i ll grant you that in exchange get to work eliminate the old man boss he s your blood relative i don t remember having an uncle like that murakami take the kijima brothers mr chairman these men say that they came from tatsumura what do they want can t you handle it yourself no i definitely can t what are you doing stop it you chairman of sanritsu industries murdered killing anyone who gets in the way but this is too much this is exactly how tatsumura works now their organization is strengthened again we have to find a new way to get inside welcome can i get you a drink i don t have any money here let me pay with this we re supposed to ask for cash don t be so uptight i heard whose restaurant this is welcome eh are you the one i need to talk to maybe we ll see boy where are you from check the family register no comment well i want a clear answer come this way here the pistol wait here manager s office i have someone we could use we heard your story go home for today what we have to check if the gun has been used in a crime if you can t tell by holding it then you re an amateur what that gun isn t loaded you re not qualified to be a bouncer move are you the boss if you really want to work here do as you re told waving that thing around won t get you anywhere got it got it nice to meet you the takeda family controls the bar area here the bars and cabarets in this area are the yoshi family s territory both are backed by sanritsu industries i m sure just as i thought so what s the connection between tatsumura and the owners it doesn t seem to be just protection rackets i bet they re into something more profitable than that okay this is their turf anyway let s provoke them one by one tojima s taking over this bar get lost goons motherfucker get him what the hell you guys the tojima family s taking over this place now if you want protection money we refuse what how did you do good ah now the takeda family s stronghold let s all go together what s that i got it from the bar earlier but there are some weird symbols in the purchase column let s check the next place too go back and tell your boss tojima is taking over this business for a while it d be interesting to find a similar ledger let s check around yeah somewhere like in here this is why amateurs are no good leave these things to the professionals it s just been high school so far now comes the college class find anything nothing of value it s written the same way as this what could this mean i m sure it has something to do with their organization six people just six people and they re raiding turf all over the place and what do you want me to do i m truly ashamed actually i m going to take care of this right now i just wanted to let you know in that case leave him be let him do his thing for a while but that s don t you get it what s a couple of cabarets and bars the point is to keep our organization unnoticed wait and see what they uncover sanritsu industries hey huh so what are they doing they re not moving at all the car s crying we ll let it rest while it can what the hell is going on he s wearing a sanritsu badge who are you calling oh it s you bro don t scare me i was just about to call you come here what the hell is going on here i used my brain a little not many people know that you and i are brothers right because we have different last names so i figured it was up to me to sneak into tatsumura s place i told you that you can t it s too late i m in so you don t want to hear what i got you got something actually i m just about to get it idiot you ve got me beat well then brother but be careful you re talking with the enemy if you re as careless as you were just now you re dead they re totally systematic in that organization unless you re a real old timer you can t figure out anything it seems so i tried to step on his income streams but it didn t work so well i m sure he s got some big source of money i ll find it eventually see you later brother all right place your bets but think carefully before betting watch closely here we go that one you choose this one are you sure this is the one too bad i feel bad about taking from a cop okay one more time we have a visitor hey stop they ve been going to bars and cabarets for a while they don t seem to be collecting laundry what are they doing okay i ll find out give me a hand hey can i get a light thanks hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey what do we do what do we do good it s a red light you stupid bastard you had me worried i see so the dry cleaner was a collector yeah but where is that money coming from a bag this big with a bunch of bills in it and instead of laundry there s a load of whiskey a daihatsu midget whiskey and wads of cash what kind of mystery is this we ll have to poke around more come on come on i went to see mr ogata i was hoping to ask mr ogata to stop you and he told me the truth you should have just told me am i such an unreliable woman no this is my problem i thought i d washed my hands of the business but they don t respect that i had to do it to break free i understand but this is not just about you good luck you re doing a good thing for the world but don t overdo it when i lie in bed there s a man when i drink wine there are two men when i walk down the street there are three men they all stare at me dead boss tojima is here what okay i ll check it out the people who loved me they all disappear little red flowers in the heart are hickeys

bell it s a draw something extra i wonder if it s just a turf war no it can t be moonshine this was the key to their secret organization so through the bosses of the amusement quarters they would get this moonshine into bars cabarets and clubs then they paid profit dividends to the shareholders then this ledger is likely a record of moonshine sales i wonder how much money they can make on this if they put import prices on such cheap liquor they ll make twenty times as much twenty times and it s not taxed compared to that protection rackets are nothing in any case we re going to find out where the moonshine factory is then we can have them by the throat first let s do all we can to find the couriers wait a second what s that they re collecting empty bottles so they finally have a job that

do i struggle sidney we all struggle so why don t we tell people that we tell people to lead a perfect life and when they don t we are the cause of the suffering not satan not sin we tell people that they re not good enough and then we have the audacity to be shocked when they try and take their own lives who tried to take their own life oh what do you care as long as no one finds out is that what

t see that every day you can respect an institution that treats you like that but of course why because we have a common goal we all want to spread god s word i have been more offended by you than anyone else i should not have to defend the church to a man of god i m not sure there s much to defend then why are you here why haven t you gone i have doubts too and when i do i pray to god you need to pray to god sidney i have he didn t answer dear leonard i m so sorry i m so sorry to do this i need some time to think do a better job than i have done be a better man than i have been sidney sync

that s scary my tweet from hell wow it sounds like it what do you think is it laughable i don t think you should post stuff like that probably not for the world to see it s too late why d she leave you anyway it was getting too dull i guess i wish i could have the luxury of saying that shut it you virgin who re you callin a virgin what re you trying to say anyway i won t be a virgin for long how d that happen a girl s coming over to my house to watch star wars together oh that s right did you hear about this maehara it s news to me i was out in ikebukuro with some comedian friends and i kinda picked up this girl named eri eri eri is a fine name don t you think he was with friends in ikebukuro and got this eri girl interested in him on his first try flirting with her on his first try eh wow she must be a real slut don t call her a slut eri has to be a false name right that s fake that s her real name has to be really it is and she s a great girl the kind of girl who will sleep with anyone that s not true don t say that so nishigami s been going on regular dates with this eri girl and he s been wearing star wars t shirts a lot lately right eri sees that and goes i ve never seen star wars and that sets it up for them to watch it at his place yep isn t that awesome well can we focus the conversation on me now that s right i mean this is supposed to be about me getting over being dumped after all right right sorry so i think about a month will do it is that how long you re gonna wait for shimi yeah i think that s about right oh really sounds about average doesn t it i was thinking that after a month without me she d get lonely too what do you think kusakabe i have no idea looks like he doesn t know so let s think about this situation as if it were eri and myself what that doesn t sound like it has the same importance it s just as important and that s a fake name it s not can you seriously stop with that it is but i love her it s love is she even a real person look let s say eri and you dated for 5 years and she dumps you how would you respond to a happy birthday mail a month later we re supposed to be talking about shimi forget eri for a second okay i m sorry but let s at least hear his take on things his take nishi s virginal take he might have a killer idea well uh i love you how s that come on that works right i like it nope nope he denied it but it was fine no it just didn t have the right ring to me well that might be your opinion you re not texting her that nope really not happening it s direct i don t think it s bad eri would be touched by that yes she would if it comes from your heart does eri even exist of course she does i have my doubts no way to doubt because no girl would follow a virgin boy like you but eri did and if she did that s funny such a weak punchline and she must be crazy that s not true such a gloomy mood all of a sudden all right time to sing you re nuts no i m not i m out of breath and holding my chest you laugh and say long time no see you say i m an idiot and didn t need to rush over like that that i m covered in a thin layer of sweat i don t know why but i realized that i need you today looks like

forget all about you shimi okay that s super creepy that s like one step away from you becoming a criminal you talk to that thing everyday yeah since when i always have creepy i put it there when i started dating shimi huh what do you mean when we d come here i d open the closet and she d be over there behing me i d act like i was praying to the picture like i m home she d laugh so much at that what s with the accent she loved it when i used to do this you used to laugh a lot right shimi i swear this is creepy really creepy shimi she s not here anymore she s not here man what s the score between shimi and sasaki hmm i think it s 6 4 right now which one s at 6 sasaki is wait sasaki is reverse what s with that face then what s shimizu at 4 for i don t know i call green just say it what re things like with her well i think she likes me oh why s that well i sent her a friend request on facebook she accepted it that very second yeah that s a start that means she was on my page right then that both of us were just about to push that button oh i get it so you think you pushed it like a second earlier yeah she was gonna push it too hell we might ve done it at the exact same time that s true i mean it was the same second though it d all be for nothing if she had a boyfriend you haven t asked her reverse reality might be bitter but at least your coffee is sweet maehara yes can you try a take where you sound more gloomy right more gloomy okay got it let s try again reality reality might be bitter reality might be bitter how s that good try it like that ah okay let s try again all right let s do it again reality might be bitter but your coffee is sweet oh you left out the at least there sorry really yeah sorry about that i left that out yeah it s okay let s just do it again but i did the gloominess right just a little gloomier right more gloomy got it gloomy okay let s do it again so ms sasaki where do you live ah i live in wako city huh wako city yeah um in saitama right i see are you going to be able to make your last train i m probably gonna have to go back to the office after this really that sounds rough it s fine so what is it you like to do in your free time i just sort of lounge around my house i ve been watching a bunch of foreign romance shows lately i get that i watch those too for real my girlfriend broke up with me recently oh really we dated for about five years that s pretty long why d she leave you she said she wants time to herself so she wanted some space so i decided to give her about a month to herself before i go on the attack again that s not a bad idea i guess but even if we got back together now i feel like she d just break up with me again in which case there was no meaning to breaking up the first time is there a meaning to breaking up to separate for a bit and for both of us to grow something like that huh so i think it might be a good idea to date another girl to have that kind of experience you mean to date a new girl while still thinking about your ex it would be to forget her could you even do that no i guess not ah sorry about that i didn t mean to ask you all this personal stuff it s fine now we re getting into a deep conversation have you had any experiences like that huh i mean like getting back together with an ex not really i don t understand relationships and stuff so well i see i mean we talk about breaking up sometimes but then we just stay in our relationship you have this talk with your boyfriend yeah my current boyfriend okay i mean he never does what he says i tell him to put stuff away and he still makes a mess that happens a lot right i guess all couples go through that i don t know about that but i guess everyone has built up discontent yeah that s true like what specifically like he ll send me a message saying what time he ll be home that night but then he ll come home way later i mean with the job that i do i m not in a position to criticize him on that no that s not true for you it s your job that s the kind of stuff that we go through i m happy to lend an ear to your relationship troubles sorry about that but thanks for listening i m on your side that s pretty reassuring i mean i actually like you oh thank you no i mean it like i really like you why don t you get in contact with her hmm you re gonna contact her eventually right what are you talking about your ex why not contact her i feel like this is the right timing for it you mean right now yeah right now get out your phone no i can t call her oh why not i just don t want to but you ve been waiting for a month haven t you yeah i don t know what s been going on with you but why would you say you like me so soon even though you ve been waiting for a month for her i ve only known you a week now give her a call you re still in love with your ex right yeah then you should be able to call her why can t you she didn t answer how do you fall for someone that easily are you making fun of me

underline sinks down it seems beyond saying but there s no way i ll trip and fall before my sadness ripens get rid of the standards by which we measure inside the web of our emotions i wave at the person leaving if your kindness is about to fall your voice hurts me so please stop you re protected in the mesh of our sensibilities and i embrance you as you lean jomasaya advertise your product or

made a mistake and now you have to fix it before it destroys my marriage my family is depending on me to bring home a title and lands you re a servant lord castleroy has offered me an apprenticeship at one of his spice houses in spain the night francis men were escorting me out of the country they tried to kill me on his orders i believe francis wouldn t you know that it s the darkness i won t rest until it s dead you can t fight it what happened to the poor girl there s a dark malignant power in the woods that creature that requires blood the darkness it will take us all the nightmares again what i endured while i was captive in that cave will always be a part of me the darkness can t reach you anymore when the body endures a trauma it s hard for the mind to let go don t let your mind sabotage you you re ready to rejoin society i m sorry i only meant no it s not you it hurts my back may i what is it i thought all your wounds were healing but this one s become infected i need to drain it there the wound should begin to wait there s something inside brace yourself olivia but when the baron insults me he also insults you king henry i must ask that you send your forces to guyenne to demonstrate your power and my authority your majesty marquis duveaux when you last presented me with your grievance what did i say but your majesty the baron disrespects clearly you did not listen because i ordered you to return home and to bend the baron to your authority by your own power this has been the source of my fury people who refuse to listen to their king or are your ears full of wax hmm hold him down what are you doing just so please your majesty i beg you henry henry what are you doing teaching the marquis a lesson not like this he s a nobleman release him i understand you canceled the queen of the bean celebration now we re talking about a party i know what you re trying to do you re trying to hide me from my own court perhaps you re trying to poison me as well hmm i m not trying to poison you henry i m concerned what s wrong with you isn t any poison i ve delivered i swear to you but you are ill you could do harm to yourself to france i have headaches they come and go but my mind is sharper than it s ever been before and the queen of the bean is nearly my favorite event of the year it will proceed as usual so any servant can become queen for the day i don t remember this tradition it s cause we were children i think my mother hid it from us for a while ah my father welcomes the temporary queen in his own way in his bed if the girl who finds the bean in her slice of cake happens to be pretty she wears my mother s crown the finest clothes and spends the day ordering servants around by dawn she has a hundred ducats a pile of gifts but she is a servant girl once more a true fairy tale ending it s a tradition i always prefer to avoid especially when diane de poitiers was here to watch my father juggling a mistress my mother and the bean queen bash and i always fled for a hunt it s all right to miss him even though he angered you well at least the bean gives them something new to gossip about it s the first time in weeks that no one s pestered me about giving you heirs perhaps i should pester you mary greer s ready to present him to you now who lord julien greer s fianc such a gorgeous cake and they re not even eating it we should send the losers a consolation gift don t you think he arrived two days ago isn t he adorable they ve had some talks and greer says he s quite nice and quite rich why can t the king find me a husband like that we ve been here a year all but rotting on the vine lord julien may i introduce you to her majesty mary queen of scots and her ladies lola and kenna your majesty it is an honor lord julien it s such a pleasure to finally meet you i hear that your family s from hungary yes my parents know greer s father through a distant cousin we corresponded and the rest is history i hope you ll find it in your heart to bless our engagement if this is what your father wishes and you of course it is very much well then you re engaged enjoy your lives together i m so happy for you greer he s certainly a step up from castleroy lord castleroy can i get you anything no need you re busy just think tomorrow you ll be my apprentice in the spice trade you ll leave all this behind will you miss it i m very grateful sir lola i have some bad news the suitor from alsace has been delayed for five weeks i m going to start to show any day now lola i promised you i d find you a husband and i will just give me another week maybe two i see your plan to keep the king out of sight has failed who else knows of his madness only kenna and a nobleman from guyenne i ve given both motivation to keep quiet but there s no telling what henry will do next have you found any explanation for this i ve checked his food and wine for three days straight there s no trace of any poison at least none that i recognize then he is mad and a mad king incites chaos and rebellion if our enemies find out we could your majesty what s this a sedative that induces a coma a deep sleep that i can interrupt with an antidote of my own design it ll be difficult he has seven tasters inspecting every manner of delivery we have to find a way to get it past them a trojan horse yes yes i ve won the bean i found the bean what is your name penelope from the kitchen well you re very pretty penelope i crown you queen of the bean ask and ye shall receive i need to speak with the king it s the bastard i surrender to the king s mercy bash father i need to speak with you you return from exile seeking favor after you killed your brother s guards it was self defense take him to the dungeon there s a threat in the woods that s why i ve returned father father you must listen to me i mean you no harm but there are people who are being harmed murdered i can t believe he came back what was he thinking father you must we have given him every chance to be free and yet here he is i m done helping him francis he s your brother he s a liar and a murderer we both know why he came back don t give him another chance to get close to you we don t have much time so listen carefully i ve bribed your jailer a merchant s wagon will take you to the spanish border if you value your life you will do as i say and you will never return i m not ready to go to spain bash what is wrong with you you never should have returned here you have to leave there are too many in the castle who want you dead you mean francis he did not try to have you killed although he could you stir up a jealousy and a bitterness in him that scares me he gets this look in his eyes it s like i don t know him it s almost as if he knows that you d have been happy without him if you had married me instead there is nothing between you and i except for my concern for you then we ve arrived at the same spot i m here on behalf of another a girl i met in the woods well bully for you and your speedy recovery don t not until you hear what happened to her queen penelope every year a girl is chosen yes and for a brief moment she glimpses the heavens of royalty ah it s the greatest night of her life but when the dawn comes she must fall back to earth it must be a brutal fall oh it s all right i mean this is so much more than i ever i ever even dreamed of but it s only one day and i would like you to be the first queen of the bean in history to think long term so if you prove yourself trustworthy we can be friends and unlike henry i look after my friends every day of the year not just this one tell me queen penelope have you maintained your virtue of course i have because well as you may know when pretty girls win queen of the bean they sometimes have a special experience with the king oh i must warn you that the king s appetite in his bedchambers can be quite rough he has the appetite of a lion and the stamina of a horse a horse that proceeds at a steady punishing trot it can be a lengthy experience well how lengthy it can feel like hours sometimes it is but if we re to be friends i can help you this is an aphrodisiac it ll help the king gallop more quickly to the finish pour the contents of this into his wine get him to drink it it will thrill him and satisfy him and you will be on to more gowns and jewels and the feast i came down here because i was worried about you and here i find you with my wife again should i feign surprise it s not what it looks like he didn t come for me oh even you can t believe that i m back for the castle s resources its armed men and horses to seek out and destroy a threat in the woods and then i will leave i promise what threat you ve seen the sacrifices in the blood wood these pagans endanger every man woman and child in the realm they threatened your own wife and they do it all in service to a monster they call the darkness i know how it sounds you sound as ignorant as those pagans a monster in the woods i saw it in the shadows myself it took a girl a girl i cared for her name was rowan and now she is certainly dead however badly you want me gone i promise i want it a thousand times more but i m not leaving until the woods are safe mary leave us please i know you don t believe me but there s someone you will believe and who is that the darkness has claimed countless victims only one survived your old flame olivia d amencourt and she s here in this castle right now leith what are you doing here we ve said our goodbyes i had to see you just once more look i wanted to tell you no don t why because you re engaged to another man who you barely know that s not at all unusual for someone like me because you re highborn and he s rich and titled and very kind to the servants and to me he seems everything i ever wanted except he s not you excuse me my lady greer lord julien i who are you i m no one i m a servant i fancied her and she was kind so i stole a kiss leith no no this is not her fault she asked me not to but i was overcome she is free of blame in this my advance was unwanted i don t want him harmed but his household will have to know of this i was going to leave this in your room it wasn t his fault is that supposed to make it better i m so sorry i know these things happen but they can t with my wife i can t have this kind of gossip surrounding my family i can t have this i ll be ruined if you don t marry me i wish i could i wish i were a better man who could marry you despite this but i m not i m sorry olivia we re so sorry everything that you endured we thought i thought that you escaped through the tunnels that night i did but i was found by those heretics fed to that monster do you believe me now this creature is the cause of all the horrors in those woods if you want to protect your realm from these devils you must kill the monster they serve i don t believe in monsters i never have but i do believe in fear and whoever this darkness is the pagans fear him enough to terrorize and slaughter my people olivia do you think that you could retrace your steps lead us back to the cave no all i remember is a meadow lined with fir trees hugged by a curving field of snow i know a meadow with some firs near where we found her i ll gather my guards you ll forgive me but the last time i went with your men they tried to kill me i gave no such order and we could confirm that if you hadn t slaughtered them francis this time i m going with you we ll find that cave and kill whatever hides within and then i am personally putting you on the next boat to spain then we re agreed you can t just kill it this isn t some outlaw hiding in the trees the darkness is a creature from hell it s not human he is human i assure you i found this embedded in olivia s wound it looked like the fang of some wild beast but the root of this tooth is like yours or mine this fang is a human tooth filed down into a sharp point human but why would a man go to such lengths for function perhaps to better feed on victims but i assure you this darkness is only a man then go and kill him and remember who the real enemy is do you know what happens to servants like leith they say he ll get the lash until his back is split open and he can no longer stand he ll spend years in that cell i love him you can t love a servant you simply can t not that what i did was much better but it is mistresses of the king are often revered but this my family will fall into ruin for what i ve done i ll never be able to face them again it s not that dire yet the gossip is already spreading these rumors will follow me everywhere i have no future greer don t say that never say that mary so you ve heard i m so ashamed please don t be look at us look where our hearts have led us we ve brought you shame well all but lola in truth there s something you should know why is the queen of scotland so concerned with the fate of a kitchen boy leith saved many lives at the siege in light of his bravery i feel that his sentence should be reduced this kitchen boy seems to have friends in high places you re not the first to plead on his behalf lord castleroy has arranged that in lieu of prison he s been conscripted for military service he departs for training tomorrow ah my queen what a vision isn t she lovely mary yes it takes a very special kind of woman to catch my eye and ignite my passion hm i should go no no no no stay now that you ve given your virtue to my son perhaps you can show penelope a thing or two about how to please a ruler go on pretend she s francis i ll watch oh you aren t serious mm hmm this isn t like you are you feeling unwell your grace i am anointed by god you are as well we are royals what could ever be unwell with us hmm i know exactly what you re talking about may i borrow penelope for a minute i have some royal customs and clothes to share with her penelope if you would i suppose the queen shall stay i m fine run along dear henry when we last talked you spoke to me about bondage you seem familiar with the practice servants talk i hear you like it it s to be expected a king must have power and control it s part of his job but even the biggest of jobs can become so dull here it s just you and me i ll take control i can give you the pleasure you offer others i have always been on the giving end how tiring for you poor king henry get on the bed get on the bed now oh i like this shh bad king you won t speak again unless spoken to do you understand split up and search the area yes my lord the cave must be close by yes my lord yes sir this way bash you come with me we ll go on foot from here you didn t give me a weapon are you planning to have them kill me brother you there go with the others you have made so many enemies why fixate on me you reached for the throne and failed nobles everywhere despise you maybe it s easier to make me the villain so you have a reason to hate me and an excuse to go after my wife listen to you you have mary and the crown and all of france puckering its lips to your ass and still you re threatened by a bastard in exile i used to look up to you you were the one person that i could rely on but i was wrong you are a traitor and a usurper well go ahead do it then kill me bash fresh tracks we re not alone i don t see henry did you manage to fulfill my request the aphrodisiac you needn t worry about that he doesn t need an aphrodisiac the king goes a little bit mad sometimes doesn t he and this is his medicine you are a clever girl aren t you i ll see that it s done i know how to handle him hmm do you oh guests would you mind come again my throne of course enjoy it my dear you stupid kitchen whore lola the party s starting why aren t you ready what s wrong i can t fit in my dress mary we re out of time lola we said we would help each other and we already have what do you mean marry lord julien what he came to france looking to make a good marriage you offer him everything he s looking for what about greer it was greer s idea she wants to help you move forward julien spurned her although she says he did it kindly it isn t fair greer is punished and scorned while i m rewarded lola i don t mean to sound blunt or selfish but i need this to work my marriage is threatened from all sides bash s return has francis poisoned by jealousy and mistrust we can never be happy while he s here and you you re pregnant with my husband s child and if francis finds out i understand and i never want to be a threat to your happiness if you can help sway lord julien in my direction i will do my very best to marry him and quickly what s spooked him what was that i ve heard that whistle before it s the darkness guards my lord do you see anyone no one for miles my lord where are the rest of the guards searching for the cave the footprints just stop what do you mean how is that possible wait there s something here what is it no don t come any closer francis francis francis my lord my lord stay back the ice is too thin where are you where are you there s a current francis francis no no francis francis breathe breathe live francis please please you are beautiful and cruel lady greer well done with that kitchen boy that nasty gossip is the first interesting thing i ve ever heard about you what a horrible thing to say you should be grateful now people might finally stop wagging their tongues about you are you all right what happened henry can be such a monster heartless and cruel at least he had the courage to be cruel to my face the rest of court snickers behind my back as if i can t hear i m so sorry but thank you for what you ve done for lola i know it can t be easy i had my chance and i threw it away i wouldn t be so sure lord castleroy i heard what you did for leith getting him out of jail into the army i want to offer my sincerest gratitude i didn t do it for him i did it for you gossip surrounds me and still you seek my favor why you have a good heart and i m too rich to care what people say what i care about is you i know i m not the man of your dreams but a marriage would put all rumors to rest it s not that simple but it is the world is cruel and it will be cruel to the next sweet girl who has the misfortune of opening her heart to someone others don t even see i see you now and you are so kind then will you accept my humble proposal yes yes i accept oh thank you likewise you look very pretty i wasn t expecting to see you here tonight i m feeling better perhaps it is time to rejoin society as you said come dance with me i m sorry i can t how are you feeling is the chill still with you i feel lucky to be alive i would have died under that ice you saved my life was that wise since you believe i tried to kill you i did believe that didn t i then why risk your life for mine you re my brother have you sent word to mary that we re back just now i spoke with the guards they found the cave but it was empty there was nothing in there but blood evidence of grave suffering but no monster if olivia got away he surely knew we d be coming maybe that s why he left rowan s hand to draw us out onto the ice i ll find him i ll see him dead for rowan and for all his victims i promise you you can go assured of that you deserve your own life far away from here maybe finally i can find something that s my own you will you ll still be my brother francis why did you release sebastian from the dungeon i just needed his help well now that he s here we need to finish this once and for all finish what bash when i told you to forget about mary i hoped you would listen to me when i forced you to watch their consummation my message was the same but when i looked into your eyes that night i saw the truth you will always covet what your brother has father did you speak to my guards the night that bash left did you order his execution sacrifices must be made what has happened to you father have you lost all sense do not question me mark my words he would strike you down to take what is yours if he is a threat to you then he is a threat to everything i want he s your son scotland england a peaceful france father stop this he s leaving he s leaving for spain tonight he s said that before and he s still here you refuse to let mary go you haven t listened to your king when people don t listen to their king when they ve wax in their ears drastic measures are needed father you re wrong he has let her go he saved my life today don t get sentimental you must cut down any threat like a weed no i ve just explained to you your son is a friend to your realm francis don t anger him he saved your heir s life and pursued your enemies if you harm this man your son you harm yourself do you hear me i am pleased to see you two getting along again i know just the thing to preserve this lovely harmony if it doesn t work this sword will take two lives tonight the last person i danced with was my wife i was married once i had little children so young so sweet in the mornings when i wake up sometimes i m i m still there lying in that bed with my wife beside me the little ones whispering laughing when the plague came i alone was immune i couldn t save them i m so sorry this is why you dedicate yourself to your work to saving others hmm you must know you saved me it s not how we imagined things is it me with lord castleroy and you with lord julien it s been a strange day i don t know if it will work with lord julien but thank you there s leith please look back please onward where is he is it done well penelope i must say i m impressed ah there she is my lovely queen now catherine penelope tells me you demanded she pour that vial into my wine she threatened my life if i failed to give it to you i did no such thing are you calling my queen a liar this is nonsense she s a servant girl you re not well she s taking advantage i have never felt better in my life i m in love catherine i m in love with queen penelope she s not a queen she didn t even win that ridiculous contest in the kitchen they say that she slept with the pastry chef to get the bean penelope my crown now give it to me listen carefully if you utter one more insult to my queen if you try to harm her in any way i will have you drawn and quartered and your limbs fed to lions and those you love shall suffer worse fates it was poison wasn t it what what are you talking about i wanted to teach you a lesson so i had the contents of that vial emptied into your wine you don t look well darling henry i wanted to thank you catherine for teaching me to think long term oh mary what s happened are you all right find nostradamus henry s drugged me catherine catherine guards how is she nostradamus is treating her now she fell into some sort of drugged sleep but she s coming out of it i m going to talk to my father francis wait your father he s not well i am aware of that he got so angry at bash that i thought he d take his head off he might kill him yet what happened did father forgive you not exactly but he illuminated me on his solution it s a bit of a horror show actually and you re both invited now on pain of death and so under the eyes of the lord we prepare to consecrate this blessed union with two sacred oaths you want me to say an oath what about your oath you promised me someone with a title fine bash i hereby declare you the master of horse and hunt what does that even mean shut up and say the words please this is marriage it can t be undone say the words i sebastian take this woman to be my lawful wife under the eyes of god from this day forward take a dozen men each morning and canvass the woods any pagan found with knowledge of the darkness will be brought to me for questioning i don t take orders from bastards haven t you heard i ve been titled master of horse and hunt so gather your horses and go out and hunt are you all right well i m married to someone i don t much like and i have to stay here and watch you love someone else for the rest of my life bash you told me that your feelings for me were gone i lied you were right i should never have come back please rate this subtitle at www osdb link ajknb \",\n          \" since mary queen of scotland was a child the english have wanted her country and her crown she is sent to france to wed its next king to save herself and her people a bond that should protect her but there are forces that conspire forces of darkness forces of the heart long may she reign previously on reign you re holding me prisoner guarded day and night or at least until i m back from rome sebastian if this girl is pregnant with your child the child is not mine no one knows of our true connection but if they learn that a traitor was my uncle you can never be king there s something wrong with isabel promise you ll care for the baby find her a home and a family hide her existence among the other children you care for i ll say nothing did you see the baby s foot it s a mark that pagans sometimes put on their newborns will the mark fade eventually let s pray that eventually comes soon thank you jeanne for taking care of her and for keeping quiet about it i m sorry i can t tell you the mother s name but a child born out of wedlock i understand poor lady she d be disgraced but i ve kept the baby well hidden in the stables could you give us a minute alone please of course your grace hi the mark is fading in a few days it will be gone and then we can take her to a convent meanwhile that little mark could lead to questions we can t answer what if they put this together with isabel if they learned she was my cousin once my pagan ties only put me in danger but now imagine the response to a heretic king on the throne we d both be targets i don t like putting you at risk every day this baby s in the castle it s going to be all right i talked to agnes our wet nurse s mother she s been helping care for the baby she agreed to take the child to her village for a few days by then the mark will be gone and agnes can take her on to a convent francis would have offered you a life without these risks we re being careful and we re lucky we only have to protect the baby from servants gossip henry is away in rome catherine is locked in her tower and you are the regent my lord my lady news henry s back and they say he s brought medicis with him oh my family oh francesca oh pietro you got my letters i m horrified my dear i know but now i have you to thank for making this place fit for a human being my darling girl we bring mixed tidings as you urged in your letters our family has thrown its considerable weight against this annulment of your marriage to henry and were you successful yes under our pressure the pope refused to see henry excellent so henry has returned here with the aim of killing you he can t he has no legal justification he s accused you of adultery that s a treasonable offense if found guilty you would pay with they say one or two of henry viii s wives practiced laying their head on a block so they could face the end with dignity but of course it will never come to that absolutely not we will be here to see any charges are fairly disputed and we ve arranged that you may leave the tower under guard to prepare your defense but just in case this is ridiculous who am i accused of being adulterous with you meant it didn t you if i say these things to the court you ll find me a suitable husband yes i promise now try to concentrate were they naked not entirely well that wouldn t be believable would it then how do you know how far they went the queen screamed in pleasure lady kenna i m not sure no no no i like that let catherine scramble for her dignity catherine tried to poison me once you could tell them that in court no one cares kenna that part s true my dear henry s only interested in offenses against himself aren t you supposed to wait outside the door so i can conduct my defense privately off with you child you ve killed me enough for one day did you miss me this is judicial murder henry we all know how this plays out when a king tries to cast off a queen i ll have a line of witnesses to your adultery a mile long all eager to say whatever i want them to say nobles servants stable boys the man who clips the hedges in the garden it doesn t matter twist and squirm all you want you can t outlast them because i ll have another and another all to wed mary to your bastard son and get her to stake her claim to the english throne it won t look good henry you re doing all this for england you re killing me for england when you go back to the vatican all set to legitimize bash you need to give them a fig leaf you need the appearance of fairness so that you and the pope don t look like the power hungry bastards you are oh my hands will be clean i m keeping a distance the evidence against you will be collected by my old friend you remember viscount richard delacroix it takes a special kind of vindictiveness to kill a woman over a petty slight from years ago petty you exiled me from court you should never have referred to your queen as an italian horse i didn t i called you an italian mule i m sure you never stopped to notice but you have made a lot more enemies than just me and now the time s come to pay your majesty your majesty your majesty shines like the sun upon our humble yes bernard where are we gervaise has taken back his request to dedicate his new play to you for fear of offending the king martin assumes his dancers are canceled and is preparing to move on to padua everyone your attention the queen of france wants it known that nothing will be canceled the money will continue to flow the arts in france live as long as catherine de medici lives and i intend that to be a long long time now let s not make that a lie ah charlotte a word is it bad your grace it s worse than bad henry will have my head and i can t win if i fight him legally then i trust your grace has another strategy well my best chance my only chance is to destroy sebastian that way henry will have to turn to francis as the next heir and there ll be no need to kill me there must be something i can use to destroy the bastard we ve watched him your grace as you ordered janet says that for the last few days bash and mary have spent an unusual amount of time in the wine cellar danielle told me that she saw mary talking to the wet nurse and the wet nurse going down to the stables several times the physician said to leave the bandage on for another three days do not remove it until then not for any reason when the burn is healed you can take the child to the convent of st clare have no fear your grace babies are nothing new to me i ve delivered dozens in my time be on your way agnes your majesty i m surprised to see you here yes i thought a ride might clear my head but you re not wearing your riding habit oh how foolish i should have changed what a beautiful baby grandchild agnes orphan left at the castle door agnes is taking her to the convent isn t that right yes your grace babies are such a sign of hope in dark times oh i hope nothing s wrong is there jeanne dear go away queen mary and i need to have a little talk that s a pagan child no doubt the mother was pagan as well i m not sure what you re imagining so what would this make bash in the eyes of the nobles the fact that he s kept that mark secret the timing of the birth which will foster suspicion half of them don t want him as their king as it is rumors are deadly to a man in that position rumors are deadly for a queen as well yes i m a good object lesson aren t i if henry can cut off my head based on rumors he creates himself imagine what would happen to bash with actual evidence one look at that baby and bash s enemies will say where there s smoke there s fire at best they ll pull him off the throne and you ll lose the alliance at worst well by the time they re finished you could end up on a stake beside him my dear if you aren t careful i m not threatening you i m giving you a chance to run home to your mother and let bash be what he s always been a playmate to henry otherwise well yes then i am threatening you it will be hard to destroy us both when you are without your head ah so it s to be a race is it well i seek to pull down bash from the perch he does not deserve you can help henry trip me into my grave which one of us will crush the other first i wonder when the ax falls on your neck i will be there with bash the next king of france hello old friend too bad you didn t see this one coming somehow i never see anything coming that could help me so we re lovers now are we well henry was never very imaginative you ve read books on pagan law you probably understand more about it than anyone who isn t a pagan themselves tell me have you ever thought sebastian might know more about what goes on in the forest than a good catholic should he seems well informed but then he s a woodsman he hunts game there it s reasonable to think he might see things are you aiming to use bash as your way out of this are you keeping your own counsel because a man marked for questioning might betray your secrets i m sorry our friendship has made you a target no harm done yet they ve only given me a look at the instruments ah the guilty couple together again it isn t funny henry it might be a little funny if you re the only one who suffers nostradamus i ve come to offer you a deal if you ll say that you and my wife have been having an affair i ll show mercy instead of death your punishment will be exile from france is that so bad you can pretend to tell fortunes in germany or spain i think not well there you are loyalty s an odd thing heaven knows how you engender it my dear you must see how frustrating this is clearly you re in mary s confidence it was your own mother who took the baby away you must know where they ve gone the convent of st clare your majesty yes but we ve been to the convent of st clare and there was no baby where else would they go where does your mother live i dislike leaving you in the hands of my family jeanne sometimes they lack my patience but i simply don t have the time to cajole the answers from you the risks catherine talked about are real you could marry me and i could be pulled down from the throne or we could try for england and both lose our heads do you want to withdraw give up our plans the legitimization no no i m committed but i want you to commit i have politically is a political reward enough to justify the risks it s not for me and i don t believe it is for you mary since childhood you were told that francis was your destiny have you ever considered what might have been if i were the dauphin when you came to court instead of my brother if you came with your heart open ready to love me oh mary it s terrible jeanne the wet nurse we were gentle as you wished our men simply stretched her a bit on the rack and her mother lives in peronne i ve already sent horsemen she s all right now i saw her in the infirmary but she said to tell you that she s worried she said they know where my mother took the baby they ll have sent men already we must get there first the medicis don t know this countryside they ll have to follow a map go by road we ll cut over the hills you re going to get what you deserve you and nostradamus who are you ghost why are you here come out into the light where we can all see you i haven t accepted the king s offer i won t betray you i wonder if you ve already betrayed me tell me about the castle ghost who contrary to what you ve repeatedly told me is not really a ghost you ve seen her and touched her bony little arm well she has a grudge against me and you too it seems but you knew that i m sure her name is clarissa she s forged a bond with mary sees herself as mary s defender thus of course she sees me as a threat and yet you have been hiding this danger from me how long has she been lurking in shadows listening to god knows what i feel responsible for her it was the year of the great storm my father came home through the floods with a newborn in his arms he wanted to see if he could correct her face correct it as the villagers said she was kissed by the devil you mean she had a birthmark going up along one cheek the mother insisted the mark be removed and my father liked to experiment he tried to remove it first surgically then with potions he managed to peel and dissolve some of the stain but the wounds putrefied by the time he stopped she was horribly deformed he didn t tell the mother this as soon as it went wrong he hurried to cover his failure he told her the baby had died of natural causes and he ordered me to expose the child in the woods why did you disobey perhaps i know what it s like to be a freak i found a couple willing to take her in paid them what i could and yet she ended up here some of the villagers said she was marked by the devil children tormented her they laughed threw stones then one day she broke she tackled a boy and nearly beat him half to death so you brought this wretched tortured savage here to live in the shadows the shadows are the only life she has i hear tomorrow s a big day for me there was another option you rejected it my hands are tied who ties the hands of the king other than a select lusty few you know i feel better about this all the time really henry is this the best you could do adultery with the court seer even the way i put you to death fails to meet your standards well perhaps you re right it s just hard to picture you in the arms of anyone you re not obliged to sleep with for reasons of state you re incapable of love i know that well enough so that s the lie that you tell yourself to justify all this however our marriage began we came to love each other in those first years don t pretend that we didn t yes that was a charming illusion you created until you tired of it and pushed me away i pushed you away who brought diane back to court who had her pointedly in his lap during that meeting with the german ambassador yes that was childish i was young and a man doesn t respond well when his wife uses him as a studhorse to sire offspring i was saving my life ten years without a child how many queens have been tossed aside or beheaded for not providing an heir my family warned me oh let s not bring the damn medicis into this you are the one who wanted me to perform with quack medicines from half the doctors in europe but without the slightest hint of tenderness or even liking i hurt your feelings the man who would have had me killed and found another queen was annoyed because i m trying to i would not have killed you or put you aside i was in love with you could you not have trusted me trust you you re killing me now we are not the same people maybe i had something to do with that trust does not come easily to me i was always taught that love was a delusion that people love what you can give them and a queen what s the use of might have beens it s too late those two naive children are dead now we killed them did we let down your hair let me look at you welcome your grace my lord this is my nephew andrew are you here to see the baby she s in the next room i just got her to sleep oh she s still here of course my lady where would she be no one s come asking about her no my lord oh we re in time then agnes we re here to take the baby away and it might be a good idea for you and your nephew to leave as well just for a while if you don t then you might be questioned there are people searching for the baby and if they don t find her they might think that you can tell them where she is questioned who would want at least six horses medicis if they find us they won t need the baby they can kill us here now where no one will know and won t that solve all catherine s problems agnes do you have another door or a window in the back somewhere to hide then there must be somewhere if those men find us queen mary and me won t be the only people to die here they ll have to kill you and your nephew you ll be witnesses i don t want to do this to you then don t we ve come for the baby old woman where is it i don t understand who are you what s in there sacks of grain and apples to store through the winter open it my son has the key he s not here there were two horses outside yes my son and daughter in law are in from town they re visiting the farm on the next hill what s that then i guess you were telling the truth after all go tomorrow s witnesses have been canceled the inquiry is postponed it seems henry s had misgivings he needs time to think thank god it may be only in a temporary reprieve but at least i ve achieved that at the price of convincing the devil you re married to that you love him i do love him richard i had to speak the truth there are times when lies lack sufficient power richard no man has ever cared for me the way you do you left court to throw off suspicion and now you ve returned to take up a task you despise all to protect me and for myself i dared not let henry appoint someone else to prosecute you who knows what they might have found don t pretend to be self interested my dear you never could pull it off catherine all these years without you imagining you in henry s arms can t you lie and say you love me best i will always love you best richard my heart you re the one man i have never lied to unless this is a lie for years catherine was unable to get pregnant she felt rejected by the king humiliated and frightened i m sure a queen who can t produce an heir so she turned for comfort to someone else who i never saw his face but the notes the secret letters that flew back and forth as the time came for her to give birth the orders to her ladies in waiting the fear the king might find out she slapped one of the ladies told her to be more careful servants are invisible to the highborn they think we aren t even there but we are i saw how scared catherine was because it was the lover s child you see not henry s and you ll testify to this i will mind you i m not one to wish my lady harm if she hadn t done such wickedness to my daughter yes we all must protect those that we love have you no evidence beyond notes you say were exchanged notes you never read i thought you wanted to convict the queen i just want to be sure of the truth well that s new why should you think the child wasn t mine what color were its eyes i can t say my lord i m afraid the witness doesn t seem that helpful i could take her and question her further i barely noticed the eyes for the birthmark over half her cheek birthmark the child was born with a port wine stain just above her lip the queen reacted unfavorably to it the girl was handed off to nostradamus father the court surgeon and must have died soon after poor thing it s not here the pagan mark isn t here what baby did you take this is the same child she was with the midwife she s useless to me useless what do you want me to do with her what do i care send her to a convent the king wishes to see you richard my old companion how many taverns did we shut down when we were younger i remember how that birthmark runs in your family you were the first of my friends to grow a beard weren t you you re going to kill me aren t you what do you want me to say that you re sorry you were my friend and she was my wife i m sorry i couldn t save you a short good bye i know if you need more time together i can have his head delivered to your chambers within the hour always generous in victory it is victory there is enough for the ecclesiastical court to render a guilty verdict and then you can have your way unobstructed and put the son of your choice on the throne pagan sympathizer though he is what or i could be wrong he might not be a pagan sympathizer he might simply be a pagan like his mother how dare you make these wild baseless accusations you have no proof i m sure this is familiar henry diane kept it in her chambers oh it s just a charming decorative sculpture if you had ever cared to read nostradamus s books on pagan lore you would know that this represents the soul of its owner it s meant to be kept in the lover s home so the lover s soul can be kept close to one s own it s very pretty if heretical diane s soul lovely if a bit lightweight heh father let me speak silence you ll have your turn let s face it henry what good is a catholic claim to england when heresy abounds here in france the rumors alone could splinter your realm and destroy your entire legacy father she s lying she planted the evidence silence i ve been betrayed sufficiently for one day go on yes i can see how you might suspect i had planted the evidence but as it happens you ve had two guards accompanying me wherever i go ha how ironic that they are now my witnesses bellows is it true did you see the queen find this object yes my lord she told us to come in and witness that everything was above board that thing was in a chest on the table queen catherine didn t plant it there would you be willing to testify to this publicly i will speak the truth my lord hmm and you did you see anything no my lord i saw nothing you don t need to teach me how rumors work i know it and i know the time to quash them is when they re still in the seed you re letting your lust for england blind you i ve had a lot of time to think about that well before england became a possibility as it happens diane chose to share her secret with me it took some years for her to trust me i m glad she did she wanted to put her past behind her to have a new life with me i d hoped once the same might be true with you that you could put your family behind you and we d grow closer but every year shows me how deep your medici blood goes you wouldn t have minded my medici blood if the hurt of my betrayal wasn t stinging you right now i know how that feels well played lesson for the day next time you see a threat large or small you cut it down like a weed understand yes you ve disgraced yourself and our family by what adultery how many of our family have taken lovers including the popes you ve disgraced us by losing yes i can attempt to escape with our money i can fashion a bribe like no other you can give me refuge in italy we can give you this i saw the way you looked at the execution block this is kinder than the ax and less vulgar in the eyes of the family safe voyage queen catherine queen catherine is just the first isn t she i suppose my cousin elizabeth is on that list too that s the deal i made with the king mary claiming england means nothing to me i was only interested in claiming you if you want to change your mind henry will never permit it the decision is yours and if henry stands in the way i ll kill him for you did you hear his advice today to cut down any threat he put my head on the chopping block to threaten you anyone who threatens you or terrorizes you or harms you i will cut down even my father you re always saying that you re not francis i can see that now yes my brother is more civilized he plays by the rules bash yes you frighten me sometimes and exhilarate me and challenge me to do things i never thought i could you don t have to be francis you re sure because there ll be no turning back you asked me if things might have been different if i had come to you with an open heart my heart is open oh don t overreact the guards are outside the door if you want to shout meanwhile there s no one to see you in your altogether except me how are you allowed to wander around the castle well i told them i was preparing an appeal to be lodged with the ecclesiastical court of course we all know how pointless that would be don t call out this is madness a few days ago i d have thought so now i have no alternative we both must die you ve already lost you have nothing to gain from killing me i m a mother and a mother who won t be here to be sure that her children are safe but i can give them one thing i can remove you before i go i mean your children no harm what do your good intentions matter i kill you and the marriage with sebastian is gone my children s inheritance restored i kill you and ensure that you can never be the cause of francis s death it s the best legacy that i can offer i hope you ll excuse the choice of poison i know death takes a bit longer but i didn t want to be cruel i promise that you ll feel no pain who goes there your grace wake up mother wake up mother open the door now wake up mother wake up mother no they told me you were dead open the door you should be dead and so should i but i m saving you get away from me go get out wait don t touch them they might be poisoned mary mary are you all right what happened catherine tried to kill me take her away chain her up like the animal she is you should have left france while you had the chance he s a man with secrets you ve made a choice that will be your ruin i know who he is and i ve made the perfect choice because together we have killed you please rate this subtitle at www osdb link ajkmx \",\n          \" previously on reign you killed 12 of my countrymen i will never forgive you for this lord castleroy i heard what you did for leith getting him out of jail into the army i didn t do it for him i did it for you my mother is a catholic ally she s under attack enemies screaming for her head and no one cares but the duke of guise do you know anyone else with an army as large or as loyal your men will report to me as they would to you why do you need i m going with you to scotland french forces march for calais this morning henry you re not well we can take calais any fool knows he can t do that it s true father s army would fail on its own but two armies do you mean the duke s army mary s army mary will have to understand i have no choice francis is trying to save his country and i can forgive him for that as i hope he ll forgive me for doing what needs to be done for scotland the english attacked at dawn took almost everything we had but we beat them back between the constant attacks and desertions we won t be able to hold the line where s your commander dead who s asking the dauphin of france stand when you address him the english have been on our soil in calais for two centuries i for one am tired of seeing them attack our lines i m sure you are too that s why you re not gonna hold this outpost anymore you re going to advance but we ve lost half our company the english know that that s why they keep attacking taking a few of us each time until we can t fight anymore and are forced to retreat we re in danger of losing this war if we don t act the soldiers you repelled come from the castle of montmorency that castle stands between us and our route to calais if we take it we clear the way so the duke of guise can stop holding the english back on the eastern front and push his men through where the english aren t prepared to defend themselves he has thousands of men but there s 12 of us you want us to take a castle not you alone all the men along the line will advance as well my lord your grace the english have been spotted headed this way we need to get you to safety so much for advancing to a bloody castle send word to the duke tell him to get here as soon as he can your grace you can t stay if the english see you on horseback if they even recognize you as a noble they ll take you out first meet your new commander we re advancing to a bloody castle we missed you at breakfast it s not healthy to spend so much time alone i know i m sorry just worried about francis i know you parted on painful terms he took men meant for my mother s protection to save french soldiers i know he had to thousands of french men would have died otherwise do all married couples have these struggles i think you redefined marital discord mary what is it my god every time i see him i want to gouge his eyes out what on earth who is he your grace pardon my intrusion but there s an urgent letter for you ah my cousins roman how lovely to see you ah hortenza you look well catherine given the circumstances what circumstances are those that your husband s left the castle again i hear he s with a mistress in paris usually you time your visits around henry s availability though it could be said he s in a bad temper of late so you would ve enjoyed his company less than usual i always enjoy his company as i know he always greatly enjoyed mine except for the day he left you in tears because he decided to marry me life is full of surprises isn t it roman has trade as for me i ve come to reclaim the team of men i loaned you i need them for a job back in florence i assume you ve no object as they ve already served their pur mary these are my cousins hortenza roman de medici mary queen of scotland i remember you as a child so talkative free with words catherine could i have a private word with you there you go more words of course beatrice please show my cousins to their chambers and stay with them to ensure their comfort mary what is it i received a letter from my mother mary de guise the protestant insurgents surrounding her castle are demanding blood it s no longer a case of fighting them if she has any hope of survival she needs to escape in secret but she needs money to do so for guards transport bribes if necessary this is awful but why are you coming to me you know i can you also wrote to me every time you feared for your life you wrote to my mother asking for help and she came through with a loan a fifty thousand crowns to recruit an army i never used that money you never gave it back either i ve exchanged ten times that amount with your mother is this really about an old debt no it s about how it feels to be a female ruler trapped and alone if anyone knows how terrifying that is it s you i d help if i could but all of the court s money is tied up in the war with calais i m not talking about the court s money i m talking about your money the funds you keep hidden in case you have to leave france in a hurry i don t don t try to deny it not six months ago you escaped the tower and were ready to disappear because henry wanted you dead how were you going to support yourself in exile you and my mother were friends once i wish her well there is no hidden money catherine i beg of you you re the queen don t beg it invites sympathy then pity then disdain give the impression that you re weak and you ll soon need a secret fund api opensubtitles org is deprecated please implement rest api from opensubtitles com that s all you may go who s there john priveaux at your service i wondered when you d get here you weren t seen i m never seen and yet your name is known in certain circles your uncle s for one he has spoken of your rise in your field a man who gets the job done a mercenary your messenger said you had an urgent matter to discuss queen catherine has a secret stash of gold somewhere for emergencies i need you to find it and bring it to me i would have preferred to have not used your services but i gave catherine the option of being a human being saving a life she refused was that wise considering you re about to steal it done right she won t even notice it s gone perhaps not for months by then it ll be too late fair enough i ll have it for you in two days how do you go about it you don t want the details i won t have blood spilled if that s what you re intending no one intends to spill blood but plans go awry obstacles come up i can t be expected to finish my job with half my tools no innocent blood then promise me i can promise i ll try but if it gets in the way of success you ll keep me apprised before any serious action is taken leave everything to me forgive me father since my last confession i ve taken the lord s name in vain many times and ordered the assassination of a dozen scottish visitors i struck my servant a slap which i regret as it was a loss of self control and she s been sulky ever since also my cousin hortenza is here expect worse of me i loathe her i m prepared for my penance father oh come bash the air s bracing we re all young and wed you must shake this black mood there s nothing that you can do that s exactly the problem isn t it i m here while thousands bleed from english swords and my brother francis will survive the war you must believe that it s true bash there s no point in imagining anything else come play is that as good as you ve got lola are you all right it s just a cramp they ve been happening this one perhaps i should lie down we need to take care of you we ll stop and rest here how much further to the english line just a few miles what is your name leith bayard sir i m in your debt leith bayard i told him you re a good luck charm who d kill the dauphin of france we were safe with you i m not a good luck charm no i know you re there or you re wise not to speak though it tells me more than you think for one thing this has nothing to do with the war if it did our negotiations will be much more in the open you d be boasting about your english superiority and for another it tells me that you don t intend to kill me at least not yet which means you want something information perhaps money and since you got into the castle so easily you either work there unlikely or you re a mercenary hired to kidnap me for someone else someone close to me in desperate need of funds who has long had it in for me a young queen perhaps the good news is that you ve chosen your victim wisely i ll double whatever they offered but you must bring me the head of the person responsible for this do we have a deal oh there you go that s a nice kick the baby s well you ll be fine too bit of blood isn t anything as long as it stops and yours did rest here a bit thank you agnes would you like more water another pillow i think all i need is rest it s getting harder as the weeks go by and you re sharing a bed with two of us one who steals the covers and the other one kicks and turns all night perhaps i should sleep in my quarters this evening that s not what i want not at all you ve been so kind to me a better husband than i could have hoped for or might deserve don t do that all i mean is i ve been happy really and truly happy these last months when i think of how things might have gone for me i d be facing these moments alone save for some cold nuns around me judging me i m glad i m a step up from a nunnery i m a bit scared about giving birth i know you fear it as well it s dangerous for women lola would you be with me at my side you d be in better hands with your lady friends i want to hold your hand you make me feel safe i need you don t i always want to be there for you that s not the same as saying you ll be with me i uh it s all right i understand it s not common for men to witness childbirth it s not that if i m careful with my words it s only so you ll understand you have a strength you have yet to realize remember that always what do you mean the queen has been kidnapped i would keep your voice down unless you re trying to alert the entire country to the vulnerability of henry s court someone slipped this note under my chamber door ten minutes ago 20 000 francs to be delivered to the base of the louis xi obelisk by sundown tomorrow good lord as you re the last royal in the castle i thought it prudent to let you know in case you want to do anything about it what do you mean the medici family has a longstanding tradition not to negotiate with kidnappers if we bowed to their demands we would never be safe what of catherine perhaps henry will pay the ransom it will take days to get word to him in paris long after the deadline the letter makes it clear that if we do not give in to the demands catherine s body will be dumped at the castle gates my dear i ve been in this situation before and there are really only two possible outcomes either catherine s kidnappers intend to return her alive in which case they ll certainly wait for a few days for the ransom or they don t in which case there s really no rush to do anything a servant dropped this at my door she said it was found at the castle gate my god that earring it s catherine s there s a third possible outcome the kidnapers intend to return catherine alive but in pieces our policy is clear we simply can t give in to their demands castle of montmorency lies before us ours for the taking what makes you so sure we ll take it did you see the men who attacked us this morning i was too busy soiling my pants your grace there was a man with a red beard and another wearing a lady s favor i saw them before twice don t you see the castle is undermanned the same few men are being sent each time they strike fast and withdraw to deceive us into thinking that the castle is too strong to take soon it will be too strong we must get there before the english reinforcements arrive wait take cover we can t fight that your grace we can t even turn and run what now we have no choice we stay and finish this or we die trying kenna told me that you re unwell that it might be the baby both fine thank you you don t look fine what is it i received word from my family s banker the dowry was transferred to my husband two days ago the money julien s been waiting for has arrived and is in his grasp i thought you were holding it back the banker couldn t not anymore legally he s owed it worst still the banker said julien has been pressing for it that he d been relentless but you have no proof he needs the money do you no but julien married me before he loved me or i loved him and i do love him but why would he why would any man marry a girl pregnant with another man s child unless he was getting something out of it and what if he did what if he s secretly broke and ashamed or in debt and he met and married a very rich girl who only married him because she was pregnant with another man s child and what if those two people fell in love anyway if the end of your story is a happy one then does how it began really matter i hope lord castleroy is your happy ending do you think of leith often everyday i pray for his future i pray for his survival even though i ll never set eyes on him again fire the english have paced wagon full of gunpowder next to the cannon for the ease of reloading one flaming arrow well aimed will take it out as well as the entire english squad you won t make it ten feet from here before you re blown to pieces if i acted alone yes but not if we worked together that cannon can only shoot in one direction at a time if you were to charge down the right flank drawing it s fire i could sneak down the left and get close to take the shot calais they don t care about calais they know how lords and generals talk of battle the men are chess pieces we don t see ourselves that way no one risks their lives for some lord s strategy we do it for those we love for our brothers in arms and so we don t look like cowards and for money i don t view you as chess pieces then prove it get us out of here alive i can t promise that but this is not a lord s strategy this is about survival that cannon is the fist of god if we stay here and do nothing it ll pound us to pieces but if we advance dispersed and on the move the english won t know who to target it is the best chance for most of us to survive greer told lola not to worry about julien but i worry all i m asking is that you get close to him feel him out on his finances no his background no why not you don t want to pick this marriage apart it came together very quickly let them find their way you know lola got pregnant by someone else that s why she rushed to the altar do you know by who no but i suspect you do some cad who can t take responsibility but she found julien and maybe she s lucky her child will have a name respectability she s in love with him and if he s not in love with her she can never be free of him they re wed she can protect her heart and as her friend i want to help her do that as my husband i want you to help me please you said you d keep me apprised before any serious action s taken i ve spilt no blood you kidnapped the queen of france and cut off her ear you really are new at this aren t you the queen is fine i bought the ear off a grave digger and put catherine s earring on it to better tell the tale besides your order was to get the money as quickly as possible by stealing it not by ransoming her the medici s are refusing to pay i could have warned you about that the ransom is a distraction what anyone would expect in a kidnapping and is your intention to kill the queen since she surely suspects i m responsible she suspects all right she s offered double my fee to bring her your head relax mary i wouldn t succeed in my line of work if it were known that i could be turned so easily i m not going to kill catherine and you won t be blamed for this and how do you intend to pull that off the queen has no way of proving you re responsible so all we need is a credible alternative someone we can frame for the crime i ll get the queen the head she ll pay me i ll give you the money minus my cut the queen goes free and everyone s happy except for the innocent soul who dies in my stead if you re worried about innocence choose someone who isn t given all the treachery and backstabbing at court it shouldn t be that hard pick a name someone this world will be better off without and don t waste time about it you hired a mercenary to kidnap catherine i didn t mean for it to go far but yes now to get out of it i have to pin the crime on someone else if you do that you d send an innocent to their death i don t know what i m capable of anymore to be frank there is one possibility for months i ve been trying to figure out which of catherine s men participated in the massacre of my countrymen at the brothel sometime ago i paid a servant to track down one of the prostitutes who escaped to find some descriptions of the men involved according to the prostitute one of the men had a scar on his left cheek from brow to chin lots of men have scars he also badly burnt his hands after the massacre this isn t justice it s solving your problems with the blood of another i know how this goes as do you that s why you came to me you killed someone in the woods when the pagans forced you to choose a sacrifice i did it for you and for myself i murdered a man who was about to kill another and to this day i wonder did he have a family did he die for his own beliefs or was he simply acting on the orders of those above him is he really as guilty as i thought at the time what s the answer the answer is you have to be sure cause if there s any doubt in your mind your conscience won t ever let you rest again mary what a talent you have for sneaking up on people i couldn t help but notice you speaking with catherine s guard you mean my guard i lent catherine my men some time ago why do you ask i wanted to employ him to help me find catherine my dear you need to be a much better liar if you want anyone to take you seriously i wanted to question him he did some work for catherine and i m curious to the specifics the whorehouse massacre don t act so surprised my guards may have served catherine but they re loyal to me did she put you up to this who catherine she s been trying to banish me from court for years afraid i ll steal her husband she already assigned that harlot of hers beatrice to spy on me now she s got you doing it too you re trying to gauge my involvement in the slaughter of your countrymen well i had nothing to do with it i loaned catherine those men long before she planned the incident and if you intend to say otherwise i ll deal with you the same way as beatrice queen or not are you threatening me let s just say i can t have either of you bearing false witness to henry when he returns if it means stepping on an insect a servant a nothing to make my point clear i don t mind getting the heel of my shoe bloody if i ve read you wrong i apologize but catherine must be taught to stay out of my affairs assuming she makes it back to the castle i was about to send the servants to look for you where have you been looking into julien s background among other things is he destitute he was married before did he kill his wives i ve no idea but i did learn of his activities closer to home he s planning a hunting trip lola mentioned it with one horse and a carriage to carry some belongings but no hounds no falcons he didn t request hunting gear of any kind you said the dowry came through yes it s in his possession you think he s going to leave her i don t know he s leaving the castle tonight and i don t think for a minute he s going hunting did you do as i asked i don t believe it did you cut off the head of mary queen of scots no i brought the head of the one behind your kidnapping as you asked what not mary then who answer carefully if you lie i won t tell you where to find the money someone who s hated you for a long time who needed money desperately you ll find proof of what i m saying when you return to the castle now where is the gold if you lie i ll find you again and next time i ll take your children as well there s a chest of gold in an empty sarcophagus beneath the apse of the church of st isabelle hortenza be fast don t miss sir they re advancing god save us all well done men all of you where s leith he was behind me leith a carriage but no hounds for a hunting trip isn t that odd bash found his lack of interest in hunting supplies quite odd yes he s going to leave me if you love julien you should talk to him see if he will share his troubles and pray that they re just financial i was just checking in on your beautiful bride thank you kenna uh no darling don t please i want to talk what you need is rest i m going to sleep in my quarters this evening so you get it and the hunting trip are you still going on it i may yes if you re well don t please don t stay with me all right but i may stop in court for a hand of cards i ll have your dinner sent to you julien please hear me i don t need elaborate things anything that you can t provide i admit i went into this marriage as a means of survival but i never would have done that if i hadn t thought i d found someone i could care for and i do i want you and you can keep me for much less than you might imagine i wish you could believe that who could believe that of a girl like you you re everything i ever dreamed of get back i want every entrance to the castle locked down till further notice catherine thank god you you expect me to believe you know nothing of this no i swear organize a search of hortenza s rooms and those of mary queen of scots i want to know everything about her her movements letters anyone she s been meeting with until i m satisfied with the details of what happened i will seek the identity of my true abductor and destroy them go leith leith over here he needs a physician the french encampment is a few miles away we will go get help join the others we need as many men as possible at the castle see that they send a rider to the duke of guise telling him that the way is open but it may not be for long hurry the war is all but won if we press our advantage you should go as well i ll be all right shut up you ll bleed out in the field as our army passes by i am not about to let you die you re coming with me oh please no i can t i can t make it please please a wise man once told me yesterday as a matter of fact that we fight for those we love i m just like you i want to go home there must be someone you ll fight to see again there s a woman but it could never work is she married no not yet anyway but she s above my station well have you considered that maybe you have more to offer her now the friendship of the next king of france do you know kings get to give lands and titles to those they wish to reward it s one of the better aspects of being king because trust me some of them are far less enjoyable you d do that for me why wouldn t i because you re merely a chess piece i have lost good men and i m not prepared to sacrifice any more especially if i can help it live leith bayard live go home to the woman you love marry her and be happy and live for as long as you possibly can but live it s our men the road to calais is now open hm roman de medici your grace i supervised the search of hortenza s room her jewel box was empty turns out she was penniless how i thought her husband left her a fortune when he died we found this among her things well bring it instructions on the delivery of money it would seem she was being blackmailed by someone who suspected she had arranged her husband s death and did she you know hortenza it s distinctly possible according to that letter she had been paying vast sums for years to keep the secret that s why she came here and held you for ransom i m sorry catherine i don t know how any of this escaped our notice for a moment what i thought had escaped my notice was mary queen of scots a child i d raised for a while i wondered what lessons she d learnt from me lately i warned her not to beg not to look weak you think she arranged all this i think she s capable of all of it except the murder of hortenza it takes time for a woman to grow that hard i was nearly when i killed an innocent i suppose innocence is all relative i wonder how long mary s will last because once gone it can never be reclaimed julien i didn t play cards i was going to leave you and i suspect you knew that i ve fallen out with my family they re not good people i don t want to go into it beyond that i only i have no money of my own i was going to live off yours what i could get my hands on anyway your dowry go on i am about as close to penniless as a son of a wealthy family could ever be and is that why you married me why you didn t care about me carrying another man s child because of my money yes but as i came to love you i knew i couldn t keep such a secret from you any longer the shame of telling you the truth of admitting that our life could only be funded by your family s money what about my shame abandoned not one year into our marriage did you think about that i wasn t thinking clearly you said you didn t want to be alone that fear made you want me at your side my fear made me want to run away what are you so afraid of all i have to offer you is me but i thought if you meant what you said if you needed less if you could live a simpler life i could i want to i want to forgive you i want to be with you but how do i trust you with time with our whole lives i will prove myself to you promise me no more lies i promise you came back this is just a sample the rest is hidden safely awaiting your instructions minus my cut of course and hortenza s body buried safely with a forged letter planted in her chambers to convince catherine of her guilt i took her head quickly if that brings you peace you made an excellent choice i m not sure there is one when it comes to murder i ve been at court long enough to know how the medicis work how they act hortenza was going to have beatrice killed her guard confirmed it i traded one life for another today and i pray that i ve saved my mother but at what price count yourself lucky it was bought so cheaply your grace it s been a pleasure doing business with you actually i m not quite done with your services yet if you re still willing that gold you acquired is bound for scotland to help my mother i need to be sure it arrives in the right hands i need someone i can trust to lead a group of men to secure her rescue there would be a substantial purse in it for you as well of course finding men like myself willing to do whatever s necessary in spite of the risks isn t easy i ve already taken care of that part follow me these men used to work for hortenza until their mistress lost her head now they work for me and they answer to you pack your belongings be ready to sail within the hour yes your grace are you sure you know what you re doing those men are rumored to have massacred your countrymen they re monsters indeed they are but they re my monsters now api opensubtitles org is deprecated please implement rest api from

treasonable offense if found guilty you would pay with they say one or two of henry viii s wives practiced laying their head on a block so they could face the end with dignity but of course it will never come to that absolutely not we will be here to see any charges are fairly disputed and we ve arranged that you may leave the tower under guard to prepare your defense but just in case this is ridiculous who am i accused of being adulterous with you meant it didn t you if i say these things to the court you ll find me a suitable husband yes i promise now try to concentrate were they naked not entirely well that wouldn t be believable would it then how do you know how far they went the queen screamed in pleasure lady kenna i m not sure no no no i like that let catherine scramble for her dignity catherine tried to poison me once you could tell them that in court no one cares kenna that part s true my dear henry s only interested in offenses against himself aren t you supposed to wait outside the door so i can conduct my defense privately off with you child you ve killed me enough for one day did you miss me this is judicial murder henry we all know how this plays out when a king tries to cast off a queen i ll have a line of witnesses to your adultery a mile long all eager to say whatever i want them to say nobles servants stable boys the man who clips the hedges in the garden it doesn t matter twist and squirm all you want you can t outlast them because i ll have another and another all to wed mary to your bastard son and get her to stake her claim to the english throne it won t look good henry you re doing all this for england you re killing me for england when you go back to the vatican all set to legitimize bash you need to give them a fig leaf you need the appearance of fairness so that you and the pope don t look like the power hungry bastards you are oh my hands will be clean i m keeping a distance the evidence against you will be collected by my old friend you remember viscount richard delacroix it takes a special kind of vindictiveness to kill a woman over a petty slight from years ago petty you exiled me from court you should never have referred to your queen as an italian horse i didn t i called you an italian mule i m sure you never stopped to notice but you have made a lot more enemies than just me and now the time s come to pay your majesty your majesty your majesty shines like the sun upon our humble yes bernard where are we gervaise has taken back his request to dedicate his new play to you for fear of offending the king martin assumes his dancers are canceled and is preparing to move on to padua everyone your attention the queen of france wants it known that nothing will be canceled the money will continue to flow the arts in france live as long as catherine de medici lives and i intend that to be a long long time now let s not make that a lie ah charlotte a word is it bad your grace it s worse than bad henry will have my head and i can t win if i fight him legally then i trust your grace has another strategy well my best chance my only chance is to destroy sebastian that way henry will have to turn to francis as the next heir and there ll be no need to kill me there must be something i can use to destroy the bastard we ve watched him your grace as you ordered janet says that for the last few days bash and mary have spent an unusual amount of time in the wine cellar danielle told me that she saw mary talking to the wet nurse and the wet nurse going down to the stables several times the physician said to leave the bandage on for another three days do not remove it until then not for any reason when the burn is healed you can take the child to the convent of st clare have no fear your grace babies are nothing new to me i ve delivered dozens in my time be on your way agnes your majesty i m surprised to see you here yes i thought a ride might clear my head but you re not wearing your riding habit oh how foolish i should have changed what a beautiful baby grandchild agnes orphan left at the castle door agnes is taking her to the convent isn t that right yes your grace babies are such a sign of hope in dark times oh i hope nothing s wrong is there jeanne dear go away queen mary and i need to have a little talk that s a pagan child no doubt the mother was pagan as well i m not sure what you re imagining so what would this make bash in the eyes of the nobles the fact that he s kept that mark secret the timing of the birth which will foster suspicion half of them don t want him as their king as it is rumors are deadly to a man in that position rumors are deadly for a queen as well yes i m a good object lesson aren t i if henry can cut off my head based on rumors he creates himself imagine what would happen to bash with actual evidence one look at that baby and bash s enemies will say where there s smoke there s fire at best they ll pull him off the throne and you ll lose the alliance at worst well by the time they re finished you could end up on a stake beside him my dear if you aren t careful i m not threatening you i m giving you a chance to run home to your mother and let bash be what he s always been a playmate to henry otherwise well yes then i am threatening you it will be hard to destroy us both when you are without your head ah so it s to be a race is it well i seek to pull down bash from the perch he does not deserve you can help henry trip me into my grave which one of us will crush the other first i wonder when the ax falls on your neck i will be there with bash the next king of france hello old friend too bad you didn t see this one coming somehow i never see anything coming that could help me so we re lovers now are we well henry was never very imaginative you ve read books on pagan law you probably understand more about it than anyone who isn t a pagan themselves tell me have you ever thought sebastian might know more about what goes on in the forest than a good catholic should he seems well informed but then he s a woodsman he hunts game there it s reasonable to think he might see things are you aiming to use bash as your way out of this are you keeping your own counsel because a man marked for questioning might betray your secrets i m sorry our friendship has made you a target no harm done yet they ve only given me a look at the instruments ah the guilty couple together again it isn t funny henry it might be a little funny if you re the only one who suffers nostradamus i ve come to offer you a deal if you ll say that you and my wife have been having an affair i ll show mercy instead of death your punishment will be exile from france is that so bad you can pretend to tell fortunes in germany or spain i think not well there you are loyalty s an odd thing heaven knows how you engender it my dear you must see how frustrating this is clearly you re in mary s confidence it was your own mother who took the baby away you must know where they ve gone the convent of st clare your majesty yes but we ve been to the convent of st clare and there was no baby where else would they go where does your mother live i dislike leaving you in the hands of my family jeanne sometimes they lack my patience but i simply don t have the time to cajole the answers from you the risks catherine talked about are real you could marry me and i could be pulled down from the throne or we could try for england and both lose our heads do you want to withdraw give up our plans the legitimization no no i m committed but i want you to commit i have politically is a political reward enough to justify the risks it s not for me and i don t believe it is for you mary since childhood you were told that francis was your destiny have you ever considered what might have been if i were the dauphin when you came to court instead of my brother if you came with your heart open ready to love me oh mary it s terrible jeanne the wet nurse we were gentle as you wished our men simply stretched her a bit on the rack and her mother lives in peronne i ve already sent horsemen she s all right now i saw her in the infirmary but she said to tell you that she s worried she said they know where my mother took the baby they ll have sent men already we must get there first the medicis don t know this countryside they ll have to follow a map go by road we ll cut over the hills you re going to get what you deserve you and nostradamus who are you ghost why are you here come out into the light where we can all see you i haven t accepted the king s offer i won t betray you i wonder if you ve already betrayed me tell me about the castle ghost who contrary to what you ve repeatedly told me is not really a ghost you ve seen her and touched her bony little arm well she has a grudge against me and you too it seems but you knew that i m sure her name is clarissa she s forged a bond with mary sees herself as mary s defender thus of course she sees me as a threat and yet you have been hiding this danger from me how long has she been lurking in shadows listening to god knows what i feel responsible for her it was the year of the great storm my father came home through the floods with a newborn in his arms he wanted to see if he could correct her face correct it as the villagers said she was kissed by the devil you mean she had a birthmark going up along one cheek the mother insisted the mark be removed and my father liked to experiment he tried to remove it first surgically then with potions he managed to peel and dissolve some of the stain but the wounds putrefied by the time he stopped she was horribly deformed he didn t tell the mother this as soon as it went wrong he hurried to cover his failure he told her the baby had died of natural causes and he ordered me to expose the child in the woods why did you disobey perhaps i know what it s like to be a freak i found a couple willing to take her in paid them what i could and yet she ended up here some of the villagers said she was marked by the devil children tormented her they laughed threw stones then one day she broke she tackled a boy and nearly beat him half to death so you brought this wretched tortured savage here to live in the shadows the shadows are the only life she has i hear tomorrow s a big day for me there was another option you rejected it my hands are tied who ties the hands of the king other than a select lusty few you know i feel better about this all the time really henry is this the best you could do adultery with the court seer even the way i put you to death fails to meet your standards well perhaps you re right it s just hard to picture you in the arms of anyone you re not obliged to sleep with for reasons of state you re incapable of love i know that well enough so that s the lie that you tell yourself to justify all this however our marriage began we came to love each other in those first years don t pretend that we didn t yes that was a charming illusion you created until you tired of it and pushed me away i pushed you away who brought diane back to court who had her pointedly in his lap during that meeting with the german ambassador yes that was childish i was young and a man doesn t respond well when his wife uses him as a studhorse to sire offspring i was saving my life ten years without a child how many queens have been tossed aside or beheaded for not providing an heir my family warned me oh let s not bring the damn medicis into this you are the one who wanted me to perform with quack medicines from half the doctors in europe but without the slightest hint of tenderness or even liking i hurt your feelings the man who would have had me killed and found another queen was annoyed because i m trying to i would not have killed you or put you aside i was in love with you could you not have trusted me trust you you re killing me now we are not the same people maybe i had something to do with that trust does not come easily to me i was always taught that love was a delusion that people love what you can give them and a queen what s the use of might have beens it s too late those two naive children are dead now we killed them did we let down your hair let me look at you welcome your grace my lord this is my nephew andrew are you here to see the baby she s in the next room i just got her to sleep oh she s still here of course my lady where would she be no one s come asking about her no my lord oh we re in time then agnes we re here to take the baby away and it might be a good idea for you and your nephew to leave as well just for a while if you don t then you might be questioned there are people searching for the baby and if they don t find her they might think that you can tell them where she is questioned who would want at least six horses medicis if they find us they won t need the baby they can kill us here now where no one will know and won t that solve all catherine s problems agnes do you have another door or a window in the back somewhere to hide then there must be somewhere if those men find us queen mary and me won t be the only people to die here they ll have to kill you and your nephew you ll be witnesses i don t want to do this to you then don t we ve come for the baby old woman where is it i don t understand who are you what s in there sacks of grain and apples to store through the winter open it my son has the key he s not here there were two horses outside yes my son and daughter in law are in from town they re visiting the farm on the next hill what s that then i guess you were telling the truth after all go tomorrow s witnesses have been canceled the inquiry is postponed it seems henry s had misgivings he needs time to think thank god it may be only in a temporary reprieve but at least i ve achieved that at the price of convincing the devil you re married to that you love him i do love him richard i had to speak the truth there are times when lies lack sufficient power richard no man has ever cared for me the way you do you left court to throw off suspicion and now you ve returned to take up a task you despise all to protect me and for myself i dared not let henry appoint someone else to prosecute you who knows what they might have found don t pretend to be self interested my dear you never could pull it off catherine all these years without you imagining you in henry s arms can t you lie and say you love me best i will always love you best richard my heart you re the one man i have never lied to unless this is a lie for years catherine was unable to get pregnant she felt rejected by the king humiliated and frightened i m sure a queen who can t produce an heir so she turned for comfort to someone else who i never saw his face but the notes the secret letters that flew back and forth as the time came for her to give birth the orders to her ladies in waiting the fear the king might find out she slapped one of the ladies told her to be more careful servants are invisible to the highborn they think we aren t even there but we are i saw how scared catherine was because it was the lover s child you see not henry s and you ll testify to this i will mind you i m not one to wish my lady harm if she hadn t done such wickedness to my daughter yes we all must protect those that we love have you no evidence beyond notes you say were exchanged notes you never read i thought you wanted to convict the queen i just want to be sure of the truth well that s new why should you think the child wasn t mine what color were its eyes i can t say my lord i m afraid the witness doesn t seem that helpful i could take her and question her further i barely noticed the eyes for the birthmark over half her cheek birthmark the child was born with a port wine stain just above her lip the queen reacted unfavorably to it the girl was handed off to nostradamus father the court surgeon and must have died soon after poor thing it s not here the pagan mark isn t here what baby did you take this is the same child she was with the midwife she s useless to me useless what do you want me to do with her what do i care send her to a convent the king wishes to see you richard my old companion how many taverns did we shut down when we were younger i remember how that birthmark runs in your family you were the first of my friends to grow a beard weren t you you re going to kill me aren t you what do you want me to say that you re sorry you were my friend and she was my wife i m sorry i couldn t save you a short good bye i know if you need more time together i can have his head delivered to your chambers within the hour always generous in victory it is victory there is enough for the ecclesiastical court to render a guilty verdict and then you can have your way unobstructed and put the son of your choice on the throne pagan sympathizer though he is what or i could be wrong he might not be a pagan sympathizer he might simply be a pagan like his mother how dare you make these wild baseless accusations you have no proof i m sure this is familiar henry diane kept it in her chambers oh it s just a charming decorative sculpture if you had ever cared to read nostradamus s books on pagan lore you would know that this represents the soul of its owner it s meant to be kept in the lover s home so the lover s soul can be kept close to one s own it s very pretty if heretical diane s soul lovely if a bit lightweight heh father let me speak silence you ll have your turn let s face it henry what good is a catholic claim to england when heresy abounds here in france the rumors alone could splinter your realm and destroy your entire legacy father she s lying she planted the evidence silence i ve been betrayed sufficiently for one day go on yes i can see how you might suspect i had planted the evidence but as it happens you ve had two guards accompanying me wherever i go ha how ironic that they are now my witnesses bellows is it true did you see the queen find this object yes my lord she told us to come in and witness that everything was above board that thing was in a chest on the table queen catherine didn t plant it there would you be willing to testify to this publicly i will speak the truth my lord hmm and you did you see anything no my lord i saw nothing you don t need to teach me how rumors work i know it and i know the time to quash them is when they re still in the seed you re letting your lust for england blind you i ve had a lot of time to think about that well before england became a possibility as it happens diane chose to share her secret with me it took some years for her to trust me i m glad she did she wanted to put her past behind her to have a new life with me i d hoped once the same might be true with you that you could put your family behind you and we d grow closer but every year shows me how deep your medici blood goes you wouldn t have minded my medici blood if the hurt of my betrayal wasn t stinging you right now i know how that feels well played lesson for the day next time you see a threat large or small you cut it down like a weed understand yes you ve disgraced yourself and our family by what adultery how many of our family have taken lovers including the popes you ve disgraced us by losing yes i can attempt to escape with our money i can fashion a bribe like no other you can give me refuge in italy we can give you this i saw the way you looked at the execution block this is kinder than the ax and less vulgar in the eyes of the family safe voyage queen catherine queen catherine is just the first isn t she i suppose my cousin elizabeth is on that list too that s the deal i made with the king mary claiming england means nothing to me i was only interested in claiming you if you want to change your mind henry will never permit it the decision is yours and if henry stands in the way i ll kill him for you did you hear his advice today to cut down any threat he put my head on the chopping block to threaten you anyone who threatens you or terrorizes you or harms you i will cut down even my father you re always saying that you re not francis i can see that now yes my brother is more civilized he plays by the rules bash yes you frighten me sometimes and exhilarate me and challenge me to do things i never thought i could you don t have to be francis you re sure because there ll be no turning back you asked me if things might have been different if i had come to you with an open heart my heart is open oh don t overreact the guards are outside the door if you want to shout meanwhile there s no one to see you in your altogether except me how are you allowed to wander around the castle well i told them i was preparing an appeal to be lodged with the ecclesiastical court of course we all know how pointless that would be don t call out this is madness a few days ago i d have thought so now i have no alternative we both must die you ve already lost you have nothing to gain from killing\",\n          \"found this among her things well bring it instructions on the delivery of money it would seem she was being blackmailed by someone who suspected she had arranged her husband s death and did she you know hortenza it s distinctly possible according to that letter she had been paying vast sums for years to keep the secret that s why she came here and held you for ransom i m sorry catherine i don t know how any of this escaped our notice for a moment what i thought had escaped my notice was mary queen of scots a child i d raised for a while i wondered what lessons she d learnt from me lately i warned her not to beg not to look weak you think she arranged all this i think she s capable of all of it except the murder of hortenza it takes time for a woman to grow that hard i was nearly when i killed an innocent i suppose innocence is all relative i wonder how long mary s will last because once gone it can never be reclaimed julien i didn t play cards i was going to leave you and i suspect you knew that i ve fallen out with my family they re not good people i don t want to go into it beyond that i only i have no money of my own i was going to live off yours what i could get my hands on anyway your dowry go on i am about as close to penniless as a son of a wealthy family could ever be and is that why you married me why you didn t care about me carrying another man s child because of my money yes but as i came to love you i knew i couldn t keep such a secret from you any longer the shame of telling you the truth of admitting that our life could only be funded by your family s money what about my shame abandoned not one year into our marriage did you think about that i wasn t thinking clearly you said you didn t want to be alone that fear made you want me at your side my fear made me want to run away what are you so afraid of all i have to offer you is me but i thought if you meant what you said if you needed less if you could live a simpler life i could i want to i want to forgive you i want to be with you but how do i trust you with time with our whole lives i will prove myself to you promise me no more lies i promise you came back this is just a sample the rest is hidden safely awaiting your instructions minus my cut of course and hortenza s body buried safely with a forged letter planted in her chambers to convince catherine of her guilt i took her head quickly if that brings you peace you made an excellent choice i m not sure there is one when it comes to murder i ve been at court long enough to know how the medicis work how they act hortenza was going to have beatrice killed her guard confirmed it i traded one life for another today and i pray that i ve saved my mother but at what price count yourself lucky it was bought so cheaply your grace it s been a pleasure doing business with you actually i m not quite done with your services yet if you re still willing that gold you acquired is bound for scotland to help my mother i need to be sure it arrives in the right hands i need someone i can trust to lead a group of men to secure her rescue there would be a substantial purse in it for you as well of course finding men like myself willing to do whatever s necessary in spite of the risks isn t easy i ve already taken care of that part follow me these men used to work for hortenza until their mistress lost her head now they work for me and they answer to you pack your belongings be ready to sail within the hour yes your grace are you sure you know what you re doing those men are rumored to have massacred your countrymen they re monsters indeed they are but they re my monsters now api

have to understand i have no choice i need the duke s army to save france if we don t win this war it won t matter what happens with mary s mother england will have its way with both our countries father if i do this you have to cooperate no more dismissing anyone who disagrees you will be a conqueror but only if we work together can you promise me that my son making history with me just like i ve always dreamed i wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier i hope i wasn t out of line it s my father who should be apologizing though he never would no one s ever stood up for me like that before or for my sisters i was surprised to see how quiet you acted around your father i ve come to rather enjoy your usual nature outspoken bold how long have you known the truth about us i ve known for some time as a businessman i always do my research but as a gentleman i wasn t about to bring it up and as your future husband you should know i m too rich to care i can t thank you enough no need to thank me everyone deserves a chance to find happiness just as i have which brings me to this i have something i d like you to look over but promise me you won t sign it until you re ready this is our wedding contract yes and since you re now in charge of all marriage contracts for your family it means nothing without your approval is something wrong no that felt surprisingly right so you are taking my mother s last hope leaving her to the mercy of thousands of protestant rebels demanding her head and my crown mary please understand i do understand you re doing what you think is best for your country not only my country if france is beaten at calais your country will suffer too france can hardly defend scotland defend scotland when have you ever defended scotland except with brave words that is not fair now you want fair we are rulers not schoolchildren blood will be spilled because of the choice you have made my mother s blood you don t know that but the blood of thousands would be spilled yes french blood i know i do not only think of france no you do not but you do put her first as any king would then can you forgive me it is myself i cannot forgive i ve made an awful mistake our marriage was an awful mistake please don t say that there were a thousand moments where i could ve done something made secret treaties sold favors even snuck away to scotland to be with those people who need me and do you know why i didn t because i love you because i am your wife mary listen when we have taken calais the first thing i will do is travel to scotland with your uncle s army we can still save your mother like when you promised you would take me to scotland with my brother like when you promised soldiers the time before that and the time before that you make it sound like every promise i make is an empty one what other promise can you make you are the future king it s not that simple maybe it should be for both of us what does that mean nothing i don t know i m only going to ask two things of you the first is that you stop making me promises you know in your heart you can t keep and the other come back to me live through this battle and don t let england cost me you forward have faith mary francis is clever and strong he ll return home safely i hope so but even if he survives our marriage is what francis is trying to save his country and i can forgive him for that as i hope he will forgive me for doing what needs to be done for scotland whatever that may be what if he can t forgive you well that will just be too bad i won t let him put my country

most merciful from muhammad the messenger of god to heraclius the emperor of byzantium greetings to him who is the follower of righteous guidance i bid you to hear the divine call i am the messenger of god to the people accept islam for your salvation he speaks of a new prophet in arabia was it like this when john the baptist came to king herod out of the desert crying about salvation to muqawqis patriarch of alexandria kisra emperor of persia muhammad calls you with the call of god accept islam for your salvation embrace islam you come out of the desert smelling of camel and goat to tell persia where he should kneel muhammad messenger of god who gave him this authority god sent muhammad as a mercy to mankind the scholars and historians of islam the university of al azhar in cairo the high islamic congress of the shiat in lebanon the makers of this film honour the islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message therefore the person of mohammad will not be shown 600 years after christ died when europe was sunk in the dark ages and everywhere the old civilizations were falling muhammad was born in mecca in arabia mecca was then a rich trading city ruled by its merchants whose wealth was multiplied by a unique privilege they housed the gods every year at the time of the great fair the desert priests brought their idols and the images of their gods into the custody of the kaaba once the most holy shrine of abraham the kaaba had now become a house of idolotry hosting no fewer than 360 different gods mecca in 610 a d bilal have you had today s count umaya not yet but this year the gods are gold when you put the gods and prophet together you sit very pretty between hmm and more gods to place in the kaaba caravan from syria hmm they must have been running they ll be thirsty put five more men on north wells how many sheep shall i have to kill for them 70 give them a hundred mecca must keep her name for hospitality and ten lambs for the leaders bread and water do the poets have in the hakim s house where verse and prose are nightly put to slaughter and and the bread i swear in there is thinner than the water oh open the space open the space you lovers of poetry to abu sufian willing and which patron of the arts when abu sofyan invites the poet in their joy is kit and love is kin where wines and cakes abound the skills of abu sofyan all revels and all songs begin when abu sofyan invites the poet in from the silkworms of china my lady a pleasure to the limb and as my lady can see a ravish to the eye yes 7 lengths 20 dinars abu sofyan s wife 15 oh gold the gods of the kaaba have their needs their upkeeps who is that man who stood there who looked into my soul carry me away from here why must muhammad come down here why don t you stop him he is your nephew maybe he will change change he is 40 years old it s unnatural with a rich wife he could afford the best of mecca yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave it is unnatural for a man who dares to risk the anger of al uzza who keeps our health manat the god of our prosperity allat the god of our family and tribes and hubal hubal who starts our caravans and predicts our fate to challenge the gods within earshot of the gods is dangerous unreasonable rebellious blasphemous yes i m afraid muhammad will harm himself i am always sad when the great fair is over i might not see the next one abu talib abu talib catch your breath zaid has muhammad come down from mount hira yet he s been up there three days no no i haven t seen him khadijah hoped he might have come to you on his way home then he s still up there three days i m afraid for him on the mountain because i don t know what it means men see the world too well from a mountain muhammad read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read he s still trembling under the blanket but he has spoken zaid what happened to my nephew on the mountain he was alone in the cave suddenly an angel came in to him the angel said read muhammad replied i can not read the angel commanded again read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read who knows if it was gabriel it could have been a dream when muhammad was coming from the mountain he saw gabriel plainly in the shape of a man standing on the horizon wherever he looked upon every turn of his head he saw him and gabriel said to him again i am gabriel and you muhammad are the messenger of god who has he told about this his wife and ali and his friend abu bakr and you i am his adopted son be careful to whom you talk tell him his uncle who protected him when he was a child will protect him still after all they say the god of moses spoke to him out of a burning bush if you do not restrain your nephew then we will he s dividing the city heart against house he s dividing the generations child against parent the young are listening to him he attracts the young we are arabs we obey our fathers our children cannot be our teachers how can we accept that the man we met in the street yesterday can be some god s prophet today dead bones can live again he says because he who created man can also make man return from the dead he says the gods might leave us and give their benefits to another city tell him we will give him authority position and keys to the kaaba and money what money he wants tell him we will give him anything he wants muhammad spare yourself and me do not put a greater burden on an old man that he can bear in your childhood you were in my arms i cannot now see you hurt if you refuse them they will hurt you he said this to me were they to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left i would not renounce my message which is from god when i am dead you may do as you please but whilst i m alive you will obey your father why did you hurt our father if i were drunk every day and played dice every night you d call it high spirits you will be more my brother than you are now you are all my children i ve given you everything i could but it seems not to be enough muhammad gives me more he give all the world more get him out of here father it s not waleed or me it s our father you tortured him wait hudayfa wait how can they say it s an invention musab when it isn t new in mecca it s new yet god has said it all before to noah moses jesus to all the prophets but people changed it turned it forgot it now god said it to muhammad again and it is new again what is it it s jafar what have you brought with you the very word of god when the sun is overthrown when the stars fall when the mountains vanish when the camels big with young are abandoned when the wild beasts are herded together when the seas rise when the souls are sorted when the female infant who is buried alive asks for what crime she was killed when the books are opened when the sky is torn away then every soul will know what it has done were you there jafar when god gave him these words dawn is coming up ammar you first then you jaafar ammar you kept your mother awake all night with worry i m sorry father where were you have you been with muhammad again what will happen now forgive him it was my fault i did it that god has helped us all our lives but it fell it could not even help itself what talk have you been listening to the real god is unseen he s not made of clay ammar we see the gods in the kaaba every day i m afraid for you you re listening to people who will hurt you i m listening to muhammad mother muhammad is generous yes he gives he shares he ll pass no man without a smile but he is spreading dangerous ideas dangerous ideas that no man should start that the rich should not afloat the poor the strong should not oppress the weak are these dangerous ideas girls should not be forced into marriage but be able to choose or refuse by only tonight he said stop the burial of new born girls i was fortunate always fortunate with your mother yes but you know that you and i nearly never met yasser and you were nearly never born i was to be buried like my two sisters but my father couldn t do it he couldn t do it the third time when the second girl was being when my father was putting sand over her she took hold of his finger the way a baby does he told my mother afterwards that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased and he dared take away his hand when i was born my father ran out of the house screaming that he couldn t do it again that he could never do it again sumayyah it is the custom but it s wrong the gods that let such things be are no gods i promised to go to muhammad s house mama we pray there yes he is a good man yes yes you go two men are following him read muhammad can neither write nor read but he can speak what did you say he can speak well so can you so now you speak up young man what does muhammad say umm they are god s words not his which god s what words a speaking god your muhammad speaks only to himself when god reveals his message to muhammad he remembers every word then he tells it to those who can write this is the quran muhammad has starved himself into dreams he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut his eyes are shut but his heart is open you kick him for his cleverness there is no purpose in that doesn t muhammad realize we live by giving housing to the gods we own the kaaba every year the tribes of arabia come here to mecca to pray and to buy from us now were we to replace 300 gods with just one whom we cannot even see who is supposed to be in taif and medina here in my house in jerusalem on the moon where would mecca be then the gods are both our worship and our revenue you cannot buy and sell god young man you are close to the whip ammar be sensible boy i have a question muhammad teaches you a slave is equal to his master this black bilal who i paid money for equal to me yes muhammad says before god all men are as equal as the teeth of a comb this is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars it gives them pretensions bilal teach this man the difference between the lord of mecca and a slave take that whip lash his face to teach his mouth a lesson whip him whip him cut him whip him do it bilal obey them they will kill you see what anarchy they bring they ve even infected our slaves if you re human enough to have gods remember they are the gods of your owner i bought your humanity bilal when i bought you you will be corrected one one god there is only one god who is stronger now your master or this one god of yours one god there is only one god bring the stones one god one one god crush him break him have you finished with him there is only one god one god you could swear the slave was preaching one god lord umaya abu bakr will pay a dinars for this slave wait now it s against our social order to sell a slave during his correction the offer is to lord umaya 200 if the price of slaves is raised we shall have to bail ourselves next year take him he is no use to me anymore kill him or take him i m finished with him we are declaring ourselves god has told his messenger to declare islam to all men open the windows let the world hear we are coming out of the darkness hear well the word of god hear well the messenger

keep him out of the kaaba lead them out neither do you worship what i worship lead them out neither do you worship what i worship silence you re a false prophet neither do you worship what i worship silence you re a false prophet finish muhammad protect the prophet finish muhammad protect the prophet messenger of god back to the corner hamza hamza you are brave he is the bravest man in the desert when he meets unarmed men muhammad is is a liar liar if you don t let him speak where s the lie and where s the truth when it hasn t been spoken yet muhammad is a fraud stand up hit me back if you dare i affirm my nephew s religion and i say what he says whoever has the courage to fight fight with me muhammad when i hunt the desert at night i know god is not kept in a house who would have thought that hamza hamza above all with his wine drinking lion hunting would come to join muhammad the more we attack him more they seem to join him where does he find his words i don t know how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain and come down three days later blazing with poetry if it were just poetry he says it s god how do we fight someone whose strength we do not understand muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies so naturally he s found an audience then we must make that audience less eager to listen to him we will begin with the weaker ones your turn have mercy stretch her who is your god answer me say it say hubal is your god say it there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god oh my god ammar your father and mother are the first martyrs of islam you are promised paradise how much are you men prepared to suffer the prophet has said we must leave mecca if you stay they will kill you one by one muhammad says that in abyssinia there is a christian king no man is wronged in his country we must leave now today uthman god be praised let us go we found their tracks and followed them but they just disappeared they were there in the desert under the vultures and you let them escape you escape they vanished if muhammad has stayed then only the weakest have gone weak or strong they ll blacken our name we re honest merchants we buy and sell in good faith we cannot afford scandal abyssinia amr you are a friend of annajashi the king yes can you use that friendship i think i can bring them back yes abyssinia rise up amr please nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one god only wait when we take this pledge we expel ourselves from the rest of arabia so wait war is in this pledge we are to make enemies of brothers we are to make firewood of our gods that is the meaning of the pledge if we take it there can be no turning back for muhammad is indeed the messenger of god foretold to us by the jews in our city so if anyone has doubt in this pledge go now and if you have no doubts then you do as i do i pledge myself to the one and only god and to you muhammad the messenger of god he is of us and we are of him let him bring his followers our brothers to us to medina sync corrections by pocong ltti this was a journey that changed the world the hijra or flight to medina only 70 people split up into small groups walking 250 miles of desert yet so profound were the consequences so lasting were the effects of this walk that from it the muslims date their calendar in this moment islam found it s future muhammad himself stayed in mecca in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely muhammad has become a nation he has received a city entering into pledges and treaties and you salool who claim to be king of medina lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed you should worry about yourself abu sufian every time you trade a whiff of perfume out the city you must creep past that man in medina he is across your mercantile throat so to speak and what do you intend to do l intend to wait and how long will you wait till you and the rest of arabia remove him to save your way of life and while you wait i should accept his call of course does he think i will give him my birthright i will not medina is worth the conversion hypocrisy of course it s a healthy hypocrisy king salool wiping his face on the floor 5 times a day praying i don t believe you he may not have to we ll do know what we should have done before kill muhammad come come and see they say that practice leads to perfection 7 young men each from a different family my own son ikrima is with them they will stab him together if the responsibility for his death is shared where lies the guilt my idea i m not sure i m part of it muhammad s body contains too much his mind his words but it is an ingenious solution and a final one no ali his cousin laid there to die for him who are we fighting they cannot go far', 'case that was your mess that s what happens when you just go after the money michelle what the bible say about money it says the love of money is the root of all evil and what does it say in there about sack chasers because i m sure there s something in there about that right as a matter of fact it

give you what can you give me the slave of my slaves no your eminence not this time look at me i can stand you said you were going to pray for me allah answered your prayers he answered your prayers thank you it is the least that i can do the situation has become critical patriarch loves him and the people of egypt love him too we have to find a way our lives are at stake don t you think you are being a little dramatic no we cannot take the risk of him becoming a patriarch he s not fit for the position he would give every cent away to native arabs and beggars there would be nothing left maybe he is good hearted and all that but definitely crazy a fanatic i would say i m not even sure about his good heart he s a fake remember he said thank you response at the banquet what thank you response this thank you response oh your eminence we only want you to become our next patriarch we only want you your eminence oh thank you thank you thank thank god you re not an actor he consorts with harlots on the streets the patriarch would certainly not like that metropolitan nektarios is the patriarch s spiritual child his creation we need something more substantial to convince the patriarch to turn on him this is not going to be easy things are much easier than what you are making it out to be patriarch sophronius was a patriarch of constantinople before he became the patriarch of alexandria he was kicked out after three years because of uh some kind of unrest he claims that uh he was betrayed by one of his men closest to him he s scared to death of losing his seat again he will not take any chances when it comes to it are you talking about my son nektarios is that who you are saying is plotting against me i m sorry your holiness but it s him we re talking about i know it is hard for you to believe that he can be a judas but it s true your holiness it is not hard for me to believe that this flesh is filth judas your holiness we strongly recommend that you don t see or speak to him again i need to be alone we are trying to protect you your holiness get out all of you out it s beautiful isn t it it is thanks to you thanks to god minas forgive me your eminence but you know what i think about that you must have faith with all the injustice and poverty it is hard to have faith you re right it s a lot of injustice and suffering but that is exactly why i believe that our life here is not all there is i have some faith because of you father is it true they release you from your duties we will not allow this they have no right to do things without asking us shame on them please let s stay calm i m sure things will be resolved don t worry your eminence we have more influence with the government of egypt than they do we are financially supporting the patriarchate if they don t give us a proper answer why they removed you we will demand patriarch sophronius to be removed and place you in his position i need to speak to the patriarch first he brought me to egypt and ordained me a metropolitan i am sure he will see me please don t worry what s going we ll support you i know his holiness is here i would like to see him please he s here but he is extremely ill i must see him can i help you your eminence i need to speak to patriarch sophronius please his holiness does not wish to see you i don t believe that what is there not to believe you have received an official letter from him have you not the letter doesn t mention the nature of my crime i was sentenced without a trial without the chance to defend myself i deserve to know why for what reason for reasons known to us go go go go we want our priest your eminence from the patriarch thank you please stay it s not a good news is it no what do they want from you now they want me to leave egypt this is why i doubt god don t ever doubt god minas the patriarch don t believe in him please don t say such things they want you to leave egypt because they are afraid there will be an uproar people will demand from the government they don t want anything like that to happen is that clear but why your eminence i m not going to do anything to hurt my father sophronius your father after what he did to you i can t go against him i need to leave very soon and quietly no unrest minas keep your faith minas thank you your eminence your decision to leave egypt has left us deeply saddened and very emotional we consider your removal to be an irreparable loss the church of alexandria is being deprived on one of the truly distinguished hierarchs we are greatly distressed over your departure because we feel an emptiness in our hearts and consider the deprivation of you to be a great moral loss we kindly ask you not to exclude us from your prayers but to remember us your friends who love you and long to be with you mrs filanthi please come in good morning mr laskaridis sent me do you need anything no we don t need your services lord have mercy on the poor the orphans the widows those in sickness and sorrow in prisons have mercy on them that hate me and wrong me and let them not perish because of me a sinner your eminence the archbishop sends his regards and he s very sorry that he had to cancel your meeting he s just swamped with so many unexpected occurrences if he doesn t want to see me it s all right just tell me the truth i d rather hear the truth can i sit next to you it s hard to be hungry and destitute and there s nothing one can do but there is something in the midst of this hopelessness when the lord becomes your only hope it s then that one can feel his presence i have been blessed lately to participate in your suffering my brother you re different than they are they don t seem to care about me they don t seem to care about me either but the good news is god loves us don t ever forget that please take these i have another pair at home what have i done i must have done something why didn t he want to see me what did they tell him he must be thinking that i betrayed him i can t bear to think that please lord give me a chance to speak to him how are you holding up my brother i do panikh das and funerals thanks to people like you but it is not enough i don t understand why the synod does not give me a diocese here in greece because they keep slandering you from egypt they keep sending letters most of them are anonymous i left why don t they leave me alone if they grant you a dioceses here in athens you will become eligible to replace the patriarch but i don t want to replace the patriarch they don t know that and they certainly don t want to be exposed so they will never stop prosecuting me i will leave and go to a monastery you can t do that you have a gift my brother people listen to you in these difficult times greece needs you what do you suppose i do then i can t even get a position of a preacher anywhere there are bishops and priests like myself that know that you are innocent and we will continue fighting for you in the synod in the meantime go and see the minister of religion and education he has the power to appoint you as a preacher sorry your eminence just one of those days when everything goes wrong how may i help you i am nektarios metropolitan of pentapolis i have been in athens now for a year without means to support myself i kindly ask you to appoint me as a preacher wherever you wish i am willing to work for food and a place to stay these are my documents and this is a letter of recommendation from the holy synod you re more than qualified to be a preacher your eminence but there is one problem you are not a greek citizen pardon me you were born in silivri that is no longer greece it is turkey now so now i m not i m not greek what am i then could you help me and tell me what i am if i m not greek forgive me for coming here and wasting your time you seem to be the real deal no wonder they don t like it who are they you know who they are otherwise with all your credentials you wouldn t be here asking me to get you a position in the church there is a place that no one wants to go to it s from the island of evia would you be willing to get a position there of course i would you re hired thank you from the bottom of my heart i promise that you will not regret it good morning good morning my dear brothers and sisters in christ blessed is the person who has a clear conscience pharisee how misled are those who seek their happiness outside of themselves far away from their own selves did you come here to steal our money too shame on you in riches in pleasures in

in him your eminence they are persecuting you from athens god bless them glory to god for your success in the land of egypt and for your willingness to support our church in times like these our church desperately needs people like you we know that you re supporting the greek patriarchate of alexandria and we re grateful that you responded to our need and came to visit us may god reward you greatly it s a true pleasure gentlemen having you here who would like to start forgive me for interrupting um but before we start the conversation we would like to know where holy metropolitan nektarios is uh wasn t he condemned a and expelled by the patriarch sophronius shame on everyone who condemned him including patriarch sophronius where is he i don t think he s in athens where is he i believe that he took the position of a preacher in evia of a preacher what s going on i m sorry but we were informed about him by the representatives of your patriarchate we want our metropolitan nektarios to come back to us as our next patriarch before we proceed with any business we would like you to make clear to everyone that metropolitan nektarios is holy and just and that he was slandered we will do that let s send an urgent cable to the dioceses in evia mm hmm now elder daniel why are you walking ahead of the holy bishop nektarios he who is already included in our church s holy hierarchs keep your mind in hell and despair not no monastery for you not yet we achieved this despite the obstacles from alexandria they still cannot forget about me ah forget about them you re the best possible person to guide our young men into priesthood dear father sophronius i have officially become appointed director of the prestigious ecclesiastical rizarios school deep in my heart i believe that this news will make you glad as you always believed in me since i didn t get a chance to see you please permit me to ask in writing for your forgiveness for whatever offense i might have done i ask you to find it in your heart to forgive me whatever it may be i pray that you are well and that god grants you many years and i hope to see you again permit me to ask gentlemen where are the students performing the church services in the church not far from here unfortunately one cannot perform services here due to the condition of the chapel something needs to be done about this obviously your eminence but the funds are simply not available we will have to find a way this is an ecclesiastical school permit me to correct you your eminence this is not only an ecclesiastical school it is a regular high school as well and our primary focus is to provide our students with an excellent education i understand but if we attend to the chapel and make this place look more appealing we will attract more students who will be able to get an excellent education of course i just can t see how we can achieve something like that like i said the funds are extremely limited as a new director i will do my best to help with that i m happy to use my salary and some of my skills and i m sure that god will provide for the rest i speak from personal experience when i say that god will provide well that sounds fantastic please excuse me your eminence let me show you to your office this is kostas he will be assisting you with anything you might need nice to meet you kostas my

asked me to read it i haven t stolen anything you liar i think i have heard enough i have no other choice but to punish myself yourself your eminence yes myself i will punish myself with a hunger strike please i would like you to instruct the cook not to send me food for three days are we clear yes your eminence go and please make amends with one another otherwise i will continue my punishment for a longer time jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner i heard you were looking for me why are the students being punished without my knowledge because we feel that you don t exercise enough authority i do implement punishments when i feel it is necessary a healthy balance between kindness and authority is best punishing yourself instead of the students when they misbehave is out of balance in my opinion it looks like your primary focus is to direct our students into priesthood not everyone is destined to become a priest we just came out of the dark ages 400 years of ottoman oppression and slavery education is vital for our development for the development of both clergy and laypeople i hope you understand that of course you are cultivating asceticism in our students and we all know that asceticism is a thing of the past it s dark age material i believe that you have a distorted view of what asceticism is mr president no i have a perfect view of what asceticism is it is a radical approach to religion it s long and long beards and painting this holy image outwardly of course a true ascetic does not worry about the outwardly appearance at all his main focus is to correct himself inwardly so he can get closer to god he s in effect a true christian are you a true christian i try to be your appointment at this school has not been filed with proper papers and the talk at the ministry says that you were expelled from egypt for moral reasons i was slandered of course you were did you request background check on me no your eminence we only asked for information in an official capacity so the patriarchal trust is bluntly informed the civil representative of the greek government that i was removed from my position because i was rebellious unethical and immoral mr riparis finishes the letter clearly stating that he believes you re a perfect cleric who was unjustly slandered but slander keeps following me doesn t it where are my accusers where are the witnesses where is the evidence of my crime on what grounds after four years of my unjust departure from egypt was this official accusation of me made an accusation that condemns me to immoral death what great wrong did i do against you your holiness why is there such a great wrath and pursuit against me seeking my total destruction the purpose of my outdated protest is to bring you to the knowledge of your holiness that your every rough against me is unjust may god be my witness and judge vassili leave the garden for me you mop the whole school already you need to rest i love this garden your eminence it makes this place look so beautiful if you continue doing my gardening i might have to take up some of your cleaning oh no don t even joke about that your eminence it is beneath you to clean toilets honest and hard work is not beneath anyone let s go and have some coffee you want to have coffee with me yes vassili i want to have coffee with you leave that here come on let s go i had to call this meeting gentlemen as a medical emergency concerning our student nicholas he has had fever for over two weeks his condition looks critical and even after doctors treatments it is not getting any better nor do the doctors have any idea what is wrong with him his illness seems to be of a mental nature therefore i suggest we transfer him to the sanatorium we need to inform his guardian right away we cannot do such a thing he needs to go to the hospital to be properly treated and diagnosed which is right across the street not some sanatorium far away from here after all he does have a fever he is here on a minimum tuition i doubt he can afford additional treatment of any kind we should pay for it it s the least that we can do for the child who has been studying here so diligently we can t bear such an expense your eminence he s here on a partial scholarship i think we already did more than doing the least we should inform his guardian immediately of our decision i will pay for it myself we ran all possible tests we don t know what s going on his health is falling apart i m sorry to say this but we re expecting the worst by tomorrow what is going on my son you are holding something heavy inside of you whatever it is know that god loves you and wants you to do great things god has forgotten about me why do you say that i studied hard so that i could come here and and help my father and my sisters but it was all for nothing my father has has killed himself and my step mother sent my sisters into servitude so you see god wants me to die let s see about that here kostas inform our students that we are going to do an all night prayer for the healing of nicholas father father nicholas woke up he asked for food god heard your prayers your eminence god heard our prayers look how beautiful they are justice and truth compel us to not only endorse the metropolitan of pentapolis but to affirm that his candidacy is among the strongest because he s one of the most distinguished well educated and irreproachable bishops that the eastern orthodox church has to offer kostas i read it i know you did i just need to point out what the most respected religious journalists think about you his character is such that if someone other than himself is chosen for the patriarchal throne he would be most pleased i d like to remain most pleased father do not say such things they wilt you i hope uh you are not avoiding your heavenly call to duty i am not avoiding anything and especially not the heavenly things i just prefer the simple people it seems that your time has come don t forget the ones who did not side with the slanderers we are praying you re elected justice will prevail this time your silence used to cut like a knife one word from you would have soothed my pain even a lie or a courtesy but nothing like i meant nothing to you at all did you really believe that i was a fraud that i wanted your seat or has the fear of losing your position blinded you to such an extent you used to call me your son remember i loved you like my father but some other things were more important to you than your son my beloved father sophronius justice will prevail today i will not be elected a patriarch thank you father how can you be happy you you should have been the patriarch and you know it everyone knows that let god s will be done kostas you are meant to do great things you don t have to be patriarch to do great things your eminence i need to talk to you your articles and your books are so full of wisdom and truth and what s more important people listen to what you have to say you know we have a serious problem with heretics in our city would you be able to write something to encourage people to stay with the orthodox tradition it would be my pleasure your eminence i need your help with this please can you make an effort to clear your status pardon me you need to clear your status with egypt they need to give you a dioceses i have done everything that i could to resolve my situation in egypt perhaps you could help me first you need to resolve the matter with the patriarchy of egypt you are considered a traveling hierarch because of your status meaning not a greek citizen i am still not considered greek you re a holy man your grace forgive me for bothering you you are not bothering me it is so good to be here there is so much light in your presence i mean not like anyone else would see it your eminence i lost my eyesight due to illness when i was very little my parents had to make a choice to let me get a certain vaccine and become blind or to let me die thank god they chose to let me live life is so beautiful your eminence i have been so fortunate and also to meet you and get your blessing what is your name xenia xenia thank you very much for your kind words thank you your eminence forgive me if i am being bold but is there any way i can speak to you again a few of my friends and i would like to become nuns could you help guide us it would be my pleasure to help you please come and see me at my office jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner so please tell me when did this idea about becoming nuns come about we have talked about it for a long time and we have all decided that we really want to do that your desire is indeed beautiful but are you aware that by becoming a nun you re accepting poverty and a very difficult life we are aware of it our life has not been easy we all grew up as orphans in extreme poverty hardships don t scare us as long as we can stay together only a few are chosen to take this path you must be truly ready and willing to go through it until the end we are your eminence is there a place where you would like to go have you visited any monasteries we visited quite a few but it s hard to find a place that will take all of us and we want to remain together so the best option would be to find a place where we can establish the convent thank you your eminence we will start searching immediately whose land is', 'of mirze as your husband i do whoo hoo mm all right all right and you

another and the wife of one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who was beating him and seizes him by his private parts you should cut off her hand you shall not lie with a male as with a woman it is an abomination all verses from the old testament since perfected by christ s new law of love and forgiveness what is the value of outdated rituals and conventions of attitudes that condemn more people than they save i am imploring you imploring us to perfect our rules in the same way and to reaffirm our commitment to redemption to compassion to love and be a force for change in the law the country and ourselves i think it s admirable to demand change but a shepherd has to be conscious of how fast his flock can move too fast and some may fall behind too slow and we ll be left in the dark morning bishop mr george mr davenport thank you for sending me your speech but i m afraid you won t be speaking today attitudes to sexual morality are not on the agenda this year i have a right to speak they re taking their seats mr jones bishop i ll be making an appointment to visit your parish in the next day or two i ll need to take everything into account so it would be wise not to have any more half naked girls parading themselves when i visit that was my si how do you rules reputations that is all they care about if they don t wanna change then maybe i don t wanna be there anyway drink have you been listening it s a job will and sometimes jobs have rules that you don t agree with trust me i know there s a call a woman saying her husband attacked her where what a domestic send larry she asked for you specifically nice place so was mine from the outside sorry i ll be with you in a minute rita daltrey sorry sir i m just the maid is mrs daltrey all right no no no no dorie you need to ask me to disable it before you open the door mr daltrey poli apologies gentlemen um i just need to telephone your station it s connected directly dorie where s rita ah hello uh yes this is gene daltrey no false alarm i m afraid thank you rita what s happening here uh she uh tripped on the stairs hit her face on the banister is it bad i m still beautiful aren t i of course you are you re my sunny girl you always will be ah that ll be the doctor get that will you dorie mrs daltrey can you tell us in your own words how you received that injury it s as gene said but you told the operator you were being attacked must have been the bump on the head and possibly the gin and tonics thank you dorie oh not again i m sorry doctor so you re a singer yes the best in clubland the magic s in the production that s where my husband s talents are doctor do rita s injuries look consistent with a fall or something else perhaps a strike with a fist wh wh now hang on well it s a large bruise even contact so more likely a banister uh yes i d say so yes inspector uh vicar i understand how this looks and i appreciate your concern but please be assured it was an accident take these and rest we can t just leave her in there just give it a sec inspector your hat what really happened i didn t see nothing sir madam asked me to give you this what is it it s johnny s business card thanks for ringing this is exactly why i told her to ask for you how long s it been going on for will listen i appreciate your interest but rita s a client so i think it s better if i speak to geordie in private i know situations like this oh don t worry we ll nail the bastard i wish i could share your optimism been trying to nail gene daltrey for years there s not much i can do johnny if rita won t talk i ve been looking after her since she was singing in pubs beautiful voice but if she used it to speak out against him what would he get slap on the wrist at best so so she wants to get away she wants to leave him but she s scared he s got this alarm yeah we heard it it s got nothing to do with burglars it s all about keeping her in it s on a timer connected directly to here and if you could if you could find out what time goes on and off i could help her escape what he s got her trapped drunk drugged up until he needs another record why can t she give you the timings herself because she doesn t know em he changes them and then he won t tell her at least when we were prisoners we had each other geordie johnny afang soup it s full of vitamins or mutton pie full of gravy i m not hungry thanks what s this about you being thrown out the conference you just can t help yourself can you i told you not to use that line about private parts i think it has less to do with my speech than someone telling the bishop about tamara being here well wasn t me he s coming here in the next few days he wants me to reconsider my position it wasn t my intention to get anyone in trouble of course not judas iscariot morning let s arrest rita daltrey the rules are ridiculous so we may make them work for us arrest her for what making a false complaint at least then we can get her alone think we can move on from that case will there s a call from the same house as yesterday the maid s hysterical someone broke in last night they shot mr gene i woke up i came downstairs and found sir like this i woke madam and then telephoned doctor harvey i thought maybe he could be saved sadly not he s been dead for a few hours now but you didn t hear the gunshot no sir could ve used a silencer mrs daltrey rita i never really woke up from the pills harvey gave me last night you didn t hear the alarm either that started when i arrived so the intruder must ve got in before the alarm was put on last night what time did you go to bed dorie early around nine so between nine and when the alarm was put on which we can get from the station right boss uh right if there was an intruder of course there was it s a robbery weren t it daltrey s walked in on em well that s what it looks like what are you getting at vicar i m just saying that we should explore all possibilities at this stage that s what the inspector usually says geordie uh larry have a look around check all the access points your broken locks latches and maybe we should continue this conversation with mrs daltrey down at the police station it must be very difficult for her here with your solicitor present of course rita calls us yesterday because gene is attacking her and today he turns up dead that is some coincidence let s not jump to any conclusions hey i don t blame her we didn t help how s she doing well her husband s just been murdered how d you think any idea who did it well it looks like a burglary but uh thanks will she s johnny s client as you know i m sure they ll want some privacy actually it might be better to have a man of the cloth present now she s just lost her husband as you said she in here as i understand my client has outlined her movements last night and the sad discovery of her husband this morning and you ve invited her here to give a a further witness statement to the best of her knowledge yeah that s right yeah we re trying to establish exactly what happened to gene daltrey i told you i was asleep rita i can imagine you re experiencing some quite conflicting emotions primarily shock and anguish as anyone would feel having lost their spouse in such a violent and unexpected way of course but in light of your call to the police yesterday i don t see how that s relevant well um if mr daltrey did attack mrs daltrey i could fully understand if vicar are you saying that my client is now a suspect rather than a witness and didn t the call yesterday transpire to be nothing more than an accident you said yourself that rita had been a victim of abuse at the hands of mr daltrey that was off the record and not relevant to this case you said it was a burglary no i said it looked like a burglary then surely that is the angle you should be pursuing instead of making baseless allegations against a grieving widow gentlemen please my husband and i had our ups and downs like all couples i m sure and sometimes i wish i had fought back but the truth is i was never strong enough rita did you see that hmm she s a long time client the way he tried to railroad me so what look uh take rita home i ll talk to johnny sorry about that will but it s my job to protect my client isn t that right may i offer you a lift home yeah thank you my office now i m sorry you say you re sorry what the hell happened he just jumped out on me i got in through the back door i made it to the living room and there he was swinging at me like a madman so you shot him i had no choice you took a gun with you just just in case my old service revolver i didn t mean to do it it just happened it just happened what do you mean it just happened you got a drink hmm you got a drink top drawer didn t know what to do erm so i pulled out some drawers took a few trinkets to make it look like a robbery just to give us a get out us gene daltrey deserved everything he got what about rita she see you i didn t even make it as far as her before he jumped out on me she didn t know i was coming last night all right she would never have been able to keep it from him and you re sure she s just a client that s not why i did it christ you saw what he did to her i would ve wanted to help her regardless and so would you and you did we did you all right it s gonna feel different without him madam how are you would you get me a stiff drink please dorie i don t think that s a good idea rita you ve had a big shock to the system but i need something well i can help with that thank you vicar dorie might i have a quick word can we get these tested for what for sedatives i took samples of drinks from the daltrey house you what what if that s why rita and dorie were so tired last night because they were drugged by who the doctor we know he was giving this to rita and he knew about the alarm larry thanks will yeah that s good work yeah you er get anything out of johnny no look i know he is your friend and i m sorry if i ever fancy a drink i can t i should be getting on with this hello empire builder how was the trip fine except for the calluses on my back on my hip will did you see mrs chapman s note about the bishop coming tomorrow i guessed from the smell of polish i i wanted to apologise the bishop asked me to report back about the vicarage and i couldn t exactly lie could i clearly not you may have the luxury of bending the rules but i ve always been held to a higher standard including by myself so for that i can t apologise well maybe my luck s run out now too probably fair enough paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison was shaken and immediately all the doors opened and everyone s fetters were unfastened finch a word if you please bible group seems to be going well it s wonderful inspiring well it s not your concern anymore oh you ve found a new chaplain no but the prison board in their infinite wisdom have decided to reduce your sentence in the light of your help exposing the reverend mr byatt you must be delighted i am morning is uh is geordie in not yet larry have you got those test results back yet oh boss changed his mind said not to bother with em d you think geordie s been himself recently when was the last time he was late for work or didn t follow up leads will the other day when mrs daltrey s solicitor was here johnny inspector keating showed him these the daltrey alarm codes are we having a party no henry jones is henry i didn t think he had it in him neither does he he s had the nerve to be telling tales about will and now the bishop s coming to see us she knelt before him obscenity let s see what the bishop says when he sees what henry s been up to drinking smoking dirty books sylvia i know you re missing leonard but you can t frame henry i ve already lost my leonard i m not losing will too excuse me uh you re not supposed to be sleeping here oh good morning inspector didn t expect to find you here yeah that makes two of us is everything all right i know i m new to this but that s what i m here for curate to care all cure from the latin curatus is it work maybe marital strife i m fine thank you henry i ll leave you to it then shall i maybe i should find will for you wasn t with you then last night either i wouldn t worry he s uh probably just with johnny well that is what i m worried about why are you worried if i have to answer that you re not as good a vicar as i thought you were you re the one who came here so something is up you tell me i m just concerned he s making mistakes at work cause that s the most important thing what does that mean you saw the state of him on our anniversary you didn t come around here then did you i m sorry something happened i shouldn t be telling you this you re his friend i don t feel much like it at the moment cathy just a lover s tiff that s what my mother used to say well he didn t hit me he never has but he wanted to you don t ever raise your hands at cathy never touched her you shouldn t even come close what do you want to hit me now go on then fine i deserve it get off me i m not your father no you re not i expected better from you well that s your fault not mine i know you gave johnny the alarm timings did you know he was gonna kill daltrey of course not it was self defence but he s seeing rita let go it makes no difference you saw the state of her you want to be angry with me you should be pleased daltrey s dead that is not our decision to make whose is it his it s the laws like it was with leonard you said yourself rules laws nonsense no the law is who you are you have no idea who i am i know i will never understand what you and johnny went through but what is it you owe him geordie what s this it s a list of the men that died in our time at the prison of war camp it was the last man s job to tell the families what had happened to their boys i was the last man by the end of the war they knew they were losing the guards would take one of us out every couple of days it started with the sick those who couldn t work and they shot him say food not that we got much keep the rest of us on our toes but by the end we were all broken so there was no order rhyme nor reason they just picked someone until there was only two of us left you and johnny that last night i said i hope they pick me he said the same but when i rolled over to sleep that night you know what i did i prayed they d pick johnny instead of me can you imagine praying for your friend to die geordie and then in the morning he was gone and then there was a shot and then another and another the yanks had armed up the burmese and they liberated the camp when we got home i lost him after demob on purpose and i never saw him again until he turned up here you both survived well it doesn t matter i prayed for him to die i begged for it that s who i am i know it god knows it now no god heard your prayer for what it was fear desperation you didn t pray for johnny to die you prayed to live look what you ve built cathy the kids your job and you cannot throw that away not for anything i ll come with you we can talk to him together no whatever happens it s between me and johnny there he is daniel told me you didn t want to be seen with him very wise we don t want you going straight back in do we no he also told me that you felt you were lacking purpose well look no further it s sylvia she needs you or rather henry does the new curate she s taken against him whatever for he s too tidy too competent too perfect he s just not you you have to talk to her leonard she won t listen to anyone else there s some chocolate for you and dandelion and burdock oh can we just get going my knees are killing me have you found the boss not yet i got those drinks tested you were right they were spiked clean old barbital looks like the doctor was putting the whole house to sleep hey mate we in the clear my lord leonard mm mm mrs c i have heard some shocking allegations of bullying during my absence you should see what henry s done to your room and this is all henry i d know this shade anywhere he s a tell tale he s going to lose willie s job he doesn t even eat meat sidney was a drunk will rides a motorbike i ve been to prison you were very hard on us all and rightly so but you were always fair well mostly we both need to accept this isn t my room anymore but that doesn t mean i won t always love you i love you too i missed you so much hello mrs chapman you tidy up i ll stall him don t worry i haven t escaped the notorious leonard finch henry jones ooh hello boy oh i ve missed you too how d you get him to sit like that oh it just takes time and biscuits a bit like mrs c how are you finding it well the parish is lovely and the congregation seemed very nice but i don t think mrs chapman likes me very much which is a credit to you i m sure mrs c s a rite of passage we have similar things in prison you ll come out stronger and will i accidently got him in some trouble and will s more than capable of getting himself into trouble but only because he wants to be out there saving souls lives helping the police he s the kind of vicar i d have liked to have been maybe you will be too single malt hmm i m all right i usually get a suite but i don t suppose it d be a couple of nights i bumped into you and rita you re sure only the best can t let you get away with it i ll help you we ll tell them the truth that you were protecting rita that it was self defence it will be manslaughter not murder geordie come on gene daltrey was a bully he had it coming i can t lie for you after everything we went through together in that well you can t let me go you like to go back then all right didn t you when we get out it s what you used to say you remember when we get out of this we re gonna go away for a weekend chicken dinners dancing drinking you kept me going and then you were gone i couldn t do it what i couldn t face you because i prayed for you to die i m sorry i d have gone

god the most gracious the most merciful from muhammad the messenger of god to heraclius the emperor of byzantium greetings to him who is the follower of righteous guidance i bid you to hear the divine call i am the messenger of god to the people accept islam for your salvation he speaks of a new prophet in arabia was it like this when john the baptist came to king herod out of the desert crying about salvation to muqawqis patriarch of alexandria kisra emperor of persia muhammad calls you with the call of god accept islam for your salvation embrace islam you come out of the desert smelling of camel and goat to tell persia where he should kneel muhammad messenger of god who gave him this authority god sent muhammad as a mercy to mankind the scholars and historians of islam the university of al azhar in cairo the high islamic congress of the shiat in lebanon the makers of this film honour the islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message therefore the person of mohammad will not be shown 600 years after christ died when europe was sunk in the dark ages and everywhere the old civilizations were falling muhammad was born in mecca in arabia mecca was then a rich trading city ruled by its merchants whose wealth was multiplied by a unique privilege they housed the gods every year at the time of the great fair the desert priests brought their idols and the images of their gods into the custody of the kaaba once the most holy shrine of abraham the kaaba had now become a house of idolotry hosting no fewer than 360 different gods mecca in 610 a d bilal have you had today s count umaya not yet but this year the gods are gold when you put the gods and prophet together you sit very pretty between hmm and more gods to place in the kaaba caravan from syria hmm they must have been running they ll be thirsty put five more men on north wells how many sheep shall i have to kill for them 70 give them a hundred mecca must keep her name for hospitality and ten lambs for the leaders bread and water do the poets have in the hakim s house where verse and prose are nightly put to slaughter and and the bread i swear in there is thinner than the water oh open the space open the space you lovers of poetry to abu sufian willing and which patron of the arts when abu sofyan invites the poet in their joy is kit and love is kin where wines and cakes abound the skills of abu sofyan all revels and all songs begin when abu sofyan invites the poet in from the silkworms of china my lady a pleasure to the limb and as my lady can see a ravish to the eye yes 7 lengths 20 dinars abu sofyan s wife 15 oh gold the gods of the kaaba have their needs their upkeeps who is that man who stood there who looked into my soul carry me away from here why must muhammad come down here why don t you stop him he is your nephew maybe he will change change he is 40 years old it s unnatural with a rich wife he could afford the best of mecca yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave it is unnatural for a man who dares to risk the anger of al uzza who keeps our health manat the god of our prosperity allat the god of our family and tribes and hubal hubal who starts our caravans and predicts our fate to challenge the gods within earshot of the gods is dangerous unreasonable rebellious blasphemous yes i m afraid muhammad will harm himself i am always sad when the great fair is over i might not see the next one abu talib abu talib catch your breath zaid has muhammad come down from mount hira yet he s been up there three days no no i haven t seen him khadijah hoped he might have come to you on his way home then he s still up there three days i m afraid for him on the mountain because i don t know what it means men see the world too well from a mountain muhammad read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read he s still trembling under the blanket but he has spoken zaid what happened to my nephew on the mountain he was alone in the cave suddenly an angel came in to him the angel said read muhammad replied i can not read the angel commanded again read in the name of thy lord who created man from his sensitive drop of blood who teaches man what he knows not read who knows if it was gabriel it could have been a dream when muhammad was coming from the mountain he saw gabriel plainly in the shape of a man standing on the horizon wherever he looked upon every turn of his head he saw him and gabriel said to him again i am gabriel and you muhammad are the messenger of god who has he told about this his wife and ali and his friend abu bakr and you i am his adopted son be careful to whom you talk tell him his uncle who protected him when he was a child will protect him still after all they say the god of moses spoke to him out of a burning bush if you do not restrain your nephew then we will he s dividing the city heart against house he s dividing the generations child against parent the young are listening to him he attracts the young we are arabs we obey our fathers our children cannot be our teachers how can we accept that the man we met in the street yesterday can be some god s prophet today dead bones can live again he says because he who created man can also make man return from the dead he says the gods might leave us and give their benefits to another city tell him we will give him authority position and keys to the kaaba and money what money he wants tell him we will give him anything he wants muhammad spare yourself and me do not put a greater burden on an old man that he can bear in your childhood you were in my arms i cannot now see you hurt if you refuse them they will hurt you he said this to me were they to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left i would not renounce my message which is from god when i am dead you may do as you please but whilst i m alive you will obey your father why did you hurt our father if i were drunk every day and played dice every night you d call it high spirits you will be more my brother than you are now you are all my children i ve given you everything i could but it seems not to be enough muhammad gives me more he give all the world more get him out of here father it s not waleed or me it s our father you tortured him wait hudayfa wait how can they say it s an invention musab when it isn t new in mecca it s new yet god has said it all before to noah moses jesus to all the prophets but people changed it turned it forgot it now god said it to muhammad again and it is new again what is it it s jafar what have you brought with you the very word of god when the sun is overthrown when the stars fall when the mountains vanish when the camels big with young are abandoned when the wild beasts are herded together when the seas rise when the souls are sorted when the female infant who is buried alive asks for what crime she was killed when the books are opened when the sky is torn away then every soul will know what it has done were you there jafar when god gave him these words dawn is coming up ammar you first then you jaafar ammar you kept your mother awake all night with worry i m sorry father where were you have you been with muhammad again what will happen now forgive him it was my fault i did it that god has helped us all our lives but it fell it could not even help itself what talk have you been listening to the real god is unseen he s not made of clay ammar we see the gods in the kaaba every day i m afraid for you you re listening to people who will hurt you i m listening to muhammad mother muhammad is generous yes he gives he shares he ll pass no man without a smile but he is spreading dangerous ideas dangerous ideas that no man should start that the rich should not afloat the poor the strong should not oppress the weak are these dangerous ideas girls should not be forced into marriage but be able to choose or refuse by only tonight he said stop the burial of new born girls i was fortunate always fortunate with your mother yes but you know that you and i nearly never met yasser and you were nearly never born i was to be buried like my two sisters but my father couldn t do it he couldn t do it the third time when the second girl was being when my father was putting sand over her she took hold of his finger the way a baby does he told my mother afterwards that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased and he dared take away his hand when i was born my father ran out of the house screaming that he couldn t do it again that he could never do it again sumayyah it is the custom but it s wrong the gods that let such things be are no gods i promised to go to muhammad s house mama we pray there yes he is a good man yes yes you go two men are following him read muhammad can neither write nor read but he can speak what did you say he can speak well so can you so now you speak up young man what does muhammad say umm they are god s words not his which god s what words a speaking god your muhammad speaks only to himself when god reveals his message to muhammad he remembers every word then he tells it to those who can write this is the quran muhammad has starved himself into dreams he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut his eyes are shut but his heart is open you kick him for his cleverness there is no purpose in that doesn t muhammad realize we live by giving housing to the gods we own the kaaba every year the tribes of arabia come here to mecca to pray and to buy from us now were we to replace 300 gods with just one whom we cannot even see who is supposed to be in taif and medina here in my house in jerusalem on the moon where would mecca be then the gods are both our worship and our revenue you cannot buy and sell god young man you are close to the whip ammar be sensible boy i have a question muhammad teaches you a slave is equal to his master this black bilal who i paid money for equal to me yes muhammad says before god all men are as equal as the teeth of a comb this is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars it gives them pretensions bilal teach this man the difference between the lord of mecca and a slave take that whip lash his face to teach his mouth a lesson whip him whip him cut him whip him do it bilal obey them they will kill you see what anarchy they bring they ve even infected our slaves if you re human enough to have gods remember they are the gods of your owner i bought your humanity bilal when i bought you you will be corrected one one god there is only one god who is stronger now your master or this one god of yours one god there is only one god bring the stones one god one one god crush him break him have you finished with him there is only one god one god you could swear the slave was preaching one god lord umaya abu bakr will pay a dinars for this slave wait now it s against our social order to sell a slave during his correction the offer is to lord umaya 200 if the price of slaves is raised we shall have to bail ourselves next year take him he is no use to me anymore kill him or take him i m finished with him we are declaring ourselves god has told his messenger to declare islam to all men open the windows let the world hear we are coming out of the darkness hear well the word of god hear well the messenger of god there are no other gods but god and muhammad is his messenger there are no other gods but god and muhammad is his messenger we have come into light join us in the march to the kaaba god is most great god is most great god has no partner we have come into light join us in the march to the kaaba muhammad and his rebellion called islam are coming out to foul our gods and dethrone religion don t let them reach the kaaba throw them back defend your gods there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god protect the prophet there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god guards god is great this is blasphemy you idiot god is great god is great god is great there is no god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god now s the time to break them there are only 30 of them no we ve done enough more will only create sympathy for them god is great stand down god is great god is great in the name of god most gracious most merciful say o you who reject faith i worship not what you worship keep him out of the kaaba i worship not what you worship keep him out of the kaaba lead them out neither do you worship what i worship lead them out neither do you worship what i worship silence you re a false prophet neither do you worship what i worship silence you re a false prophet finish muhammad protect the prophet finish muhammad protect the prophet messenger of god back to the corner hamza hamza you are brave he is the bravest man in the desert when he meets unarmed men muhammad is is a liar liar if you don t let him speak where s the lie and where s the truth when it hasn t been spoken yet muhammad is a fraud stand up hit me back if you dare i affirm my nephew s religion and i say what he says whoever has the courage to fight fight with me muhammad when i hunt the desert at night i know god is not kept in a house who would have thought that hamza hamza above all with his wine drinking lion hunting would come to join muhammad the more we attack him more they seem to join him where does he find his words i don t know how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain and come down three days later blazing with poetry if it were just poetry he says it s god how do we fight someone whose strength we do not understand muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies so naturally he s found an audience then we must make that audience less eager to listen to him we will begin with the weaker ones your turn have mercy stretch her who is your god answer me say it say hubal is your god say it there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god oh my god ammar your father and mother are the first martyrs of islam you are promised paradise how much are you men prepared to suffer the prophet has said we must leave mecca if you stay they will kill you one by one muhammad says that in abyssinia there is a christian king no man is wronged in his country we must leave now today uthman god be praised let us go we found their tracks and followed them but they just disappeared they were there in the desert under the vultures and you let them escape you escape they vanished if muhammad has stayed then only the weakest have gone weak or strong they ll blacken our name we re honest merchants we buy and sell in good faith we cannot afford scandal abyssinia amr you are a friend of annajashi the king yes can you use that friendship i think i can bring them back yes abyssinia rise up amr please nothing you may ask for that we will not give lion of judah i i don t know where to begin you have our friendship begin there certain runaway slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom slaves go back as you no doubt would returned our slaves to us there are however some free men among them rebels rebels disturbance in arabia why am i not informed they are rebels in religion at one time or another all religions were rebellions the bodies of slaves of the world and beaten are disposal but as jesus christ as our shepherd the souls of men are his sheep these are arabs who have betrayed the religion of their fathers they follow a lunatic they call a prophet but i cannot put souls into chains without hearing them good they re stiff next we ll hang them do you not bow to yourself before your prophet muhammad is a man we kneel only to god where are muhammad s miracles jafar if he were a prophet he d light the sky with miracles indeed this is true god has given his prophets the signs of miracles that we may recognize them the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran a book a book written by an illiterate attributed to god i think the emperor has had enough i m mindful of petty costs when god set down tongues of fire upon the heads of christ s apostles so they could speak the many languages of the world that they knew not before but do such miracles happen in our times i ve heard enough you ve made a poor case when we suffered persecution in mecca muhammad told us go to abyssinia the land of the righteous king where no man is wronged what they call persecution was fair punishment that is order now why did your prophet send you to me because you believe in the book of the one god as we do he sent us because in your heart god will protect us talking with him is like drawing water from a mirage but they ve now belay that duty on me to listen to them my friend go on for years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture we lived in ignorance of god we had few earthly laws and no heavenly laws the rich neglect the poor and the natural pity of man whereby he lifts his brother up when he has fallen is described by them as upsetting social order to this inhumanity has come a man whom god chose and in that we believe you ve overcome i beg you to collect yourself i speak of the messenger of god muhammad teaches us to worship one god to speak truth to love our neighbors as ourselves to give charity even a smile can be charity to protect women from misuse to shelter orphans and to turn away from gods of wood and stone i cannot keep still and hear this blasphemy we are an ancient civilization to call our gods wood and stone is to speak ignorantly of them the idol the form is not what we worship but the spirit that resides within the form i agree that idolatry is not always fully understood thank you now let me bring him back to the women god made woman to be the proper companion of man she is different but equal equal we buy them feed them clothe them use them discard them women equal to us god created man from one male and one female amr you must respect in all woman the womb that bore you why are your guards so tongue tied while this only guard is eloquent god has spoken to us before through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ why should we be so surprised that god speaks to us now through muhammad who taught you those names they are named in the quran i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep and we knew christ as a carpenter what christ says and what your muhammad says is like two raised from the same land they are lying to you they deny christ you worship three gods they say father son and holy ghost they say what do you say of christ they say god cannot have a son christ is not the son of god speak to me of christ we say of christ what our prophet has taught us that god cast his holy spirit into the womb of a virgin named mary and that she conceived christ the apostle of god the apostle he says not the son not the son what does your miracle your quran say of the birth of our dear lord jesus christ may i relate the words come closer to me in the name of god most gracious most merciful relate in the book the story of mary how she withdrew from her family to a place in the east how we sent to her our angel gabriel who said i am a messenger from your god to announce the birth of a holy son to you she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me and gabriel replied for your lord says it will happen we appoint him as a sign onto man and a mercy from us it is a thing ordained the difference between us and you is not bigger than this line not for a mountain of gold will i give them up to you you may live in abyssinia in peace for as long as you wish may god s blessings be upon you when you return lntolerable mohamed disturbs even our foreign alliances very well we will make a foreigner of him abu talib has his arms around him very well we will throw uncle and nephew out in one bundle his whole family out we will expel them from ourselves no merchant may trade with them no land remain to them no roof shelter them no beggar beg for them no woman marry them until they renounce they can t these were the worst years of muhammad s life for three years they suffered the hunger thirst cruelty of the open desert but the year of grief was still to come when khadija muhammad s wife for 24 years died when abu talib his old protector died with his last breath abu talib tried again to reconcile mecca and muhammad he never asked more from you than one word one one god if it were only a question of one word we would have given him ten words but the word he wants would dethrone all the gods you were afraid even to hear him with the death of his uncle muhammad has now lost all protection he was no longer safe in mecca alone with zaid his adopted son he went to the hillside town of taif he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert what are you doing stop stop leave him alone go away muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life then miraculously when muhammad s mission seemed to have failed his entire situation changed a deputation from the rich but self destroying city of medina met him by night at the rocks of aqaba asking him to come to them to stand between their factions to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge that they worship the one god only wait when we take this pledge we expel ourselves from the rest of arabia so wait war is in this pledge we are to make enemies of brothers we are to make firewood of our gods that is the meaning of the pledge if we take it there can be no turning back for muhammad is indeed the messenger of god foretold to us by the jews in our city so if anyone has doubt in this pledge go now and if you have no doubts then you do as i do i pledge myself to the one and only god and to you muhammad the messenger of god he is of us and we are of him let him bring his followers our brothers to us to medina sync corrections by pocong ltti this was a journey that changed the world the hijra or flight to medina only 70 people split up into small groups walking 250 miles of desert yet so profound were the consequences so lasting were the effects of this walk that from it the muslims date their calendar in this moment islam found it s future muhammad himself stayed in mecca in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely muhammad has become a nation he has received a city entering into pledges and treaties and you salool who claim to be king of medina lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed you should worry about yourself abu sufian every time you trade a whiff of perfume out the city you must creep past that man in medina he is across your mercantile throat so to speak and what do you intend to do l intend to wait and how long will you wait till you and the rest of arabia remove him to save your way of life and while you wait i should accept his call of course does he think i will give him my birthright i will not medina is worth the conversion hypocrisy of course it s a healthy hypocrisy king salool wiping his face on the floor 5 times a day praying i don t believe you he may not have to we ll do know what we should have done before kill muhammad come come and see they say that practice leads to perfection 7 young men each from a different family my own son ikrima is with them they will stab him together if the responsibility for his death is shared where lies the guilt my idea i m not sure i m part of it muhammad s body contains too much his mind his words but it is an ingenious solution and a final one no ali his cousin laid there to die for him who are we fighting they cannot go far',\n","   'case that was your mess that s what happens when you just go after the money michelle what the

to give you what can you give me the slave of my slaves no your eminence not this time look at me i can stand you said you were going to pray for me allah answered your prayers he answered your prayers thank you it is the least that i can do the situation has become critical patriarch loves him and the people of egypt love him too we have to find a way our lives are at stake don t you think you are being a little dramatic no we cannot take the risk of him becoming a patriarch he s not fit for the position he would give every cent away to native arabs and beggars there would be nothing left maybe he is good hearted and all that but definitely crazy a fanatic i would say i m not even sure about his good heart he s a fake remember he said thank you response at the banquet what thank you response this thank you response oh your eminence we only want you to become our next patriarch we only want you your eminence oh thank you thank you thank thank god you re not an actor he consorts with harlots on the streets the patriarch would certainly not like that metropolitan nektarios is the patriarch s spiritual child his creation we need something more substantial to convince the patriarch to turn on him this is not going to be easy things are much easier than what you are making it out to be patriarch sophronius was a patriarch of constantinople before he became the patriarch of alexandria he was kicked out after three years because of uh some kind of unrest he claims that uh he was betrayed by one of his men closest to him he s scared to death of losing his seat again he will not take any chances when it comes to it are you talking about my son nektarios is that who you are saying is plotting against me i m sorry your holiness but it s him we re talking about i know it is hard for you to believe that he can be a judas but it s true your holiness it is not hard for me to believe that this flesh is filth judas your holiness we strongly recommend that you don t see or speak to him again i need to be alone we are trying to protect you your holiness get out all of you out it s beautiful isn t it it is thanks to you thanks to god minas forgive me your eminence but you know what i think about that you must have faith with all the injustice and poverty it is hard to have faith you re right it s a lot of injustice and suffering but that is exactly why i believe that our life here is not all there is i have some faith because of you father is it true they release you from your duties we will not allow this they have no right to do things without asking us shame on them please let s stay calm i m sure things will be resolved don t worry your eminence we have more influence with the government of egypt than they do we are financially supporting the patriarchate if they don t give us a proper answer why they removed you we will demand patriarch sophronius to be removed and place you in his position i need to speak to the patriarch first he brought me to egypt and ordained me a metropolitan i am sure he will see me please don t worry what s going we ll support you i know his holiness is here i would like to see him please he s here but he is extremely ill i must see him can i help you your eminence i need to speak to patriarch sophronius please his holiness does not wish to see you i don t believe that what is there not to believe you have received an official letter from him have you not the letter doesn t mention the nature of my crime i was sentenced without a trial without the chance to defend myself i deserve to know why for what reason for reasons known to us go go go go we want our priest your eminence from the patriarch thank you please stay it s not a good news is it no what do they want from you now they want me to leave egypt this is why i doubt god don t ever doubt god minas the patriarch don t believe in him please don t say such things they want you to leave egypt because they are afraid there will be an uproar people will demand from the government they don t want anything like that to happen is that clear but why your eminence i m not going to do anything to hurt my father sophronius your father after what he did to you i can t go against him i need to leave very soon and quietly no unrest minas keep your faith minas thank you your eminence your decision to leave egypt has left us deeply saddened and very emotional we consider your removal to be an irreparable loss the church of alexandria is being deprived on one of the truly distinguished hierarchs we are greatly distressed over your departure because we feel an emptiness in our hearts and consider the deprivation of you to be a great moral loss we kindly ask you not to exclude us from your prayers but to remember us your friends who love you and long to be with you mrs filanthi please come in good morning mr laskaridis sent me do you need anything no we don t need your services lord have mercy on the poor the orphans the widows those in sickness and sorrow in prisons have mercy on them that hate me and wrong me and let them not perish because of me a sinner your eminence the archbishop sends his regards and he s very sorry that he had to cancel your meeting he s just swamped with so many unexpected occurrences if he doesn t want to see me it s all right just tell me the truth i d rather hear the truth can i sit next to you it s hard to be hungry and destitute and there s nothing one can do but there is something in the midst of this hopelessness when the lord becomes your only hope it s then that one can feel his presence i have been blessed lately to participate in your suffering my brother you re different than they are they don t seem to care about me they don t seem to care about me either but the good news is god loves us don t ever forget that please take these i have another pair at home what have i done i must have done something why didn t he want to see me what did they tell him he must be thinking that i betrayed him i can t bear to think that please lord give me a chance to speak to him how are you holding up my brother i do panikh das and funerals thanks to people like you but it is not enough i don t understand why the synod does not give me a diocese here in greece because they keep slandering you from egypt they keep sending letters most of them are anonymous i left why don t they leave me alone if they grant you a dioceses here in athens you will become eligible to replace the patriarch but i don t want to replace the patriarch they don t know that and they certainly don t want to be exposed so they will never stop prosecuting me i will leave and go to a monastery you can t do that you have a gift my brother people listen to you in these difficult times greece needs you what do you suppose i do then i can t even get a position of a preacher anywhere there are bishops and priests like myself that know that you are innocent and we will continue fighting for you in the synod in the meantime go and see the minister of religion and education he has the power to appoint you as a preacher sorry your eminence just one of those days when everything goes wrong how may i help you i am nektarios metropolitan of pentapolis i have been in athens now for a year without means to support myself i kindly ask you to appoint me as a preacher wherever you wish i am willing to work for food and a place to stay these are my documents and this is a letter of recommendation from the holy synod you re more than qualified to be a preacher your eminence but there is one problem you are not a greek citizen pardon me you were born in silivri that is no longer greece it is turkey now so now i m not i m not greek what am i then could you help me and tell me what i am if i m not greek forgive me for coming here and wasting your time you seem to be the real deal no wonder they don t like it who are they you know who they are otherwise with all your credentials you

in him your eminence they are persecuting you from athens god bless them glory to god for your success in the land of egypt and for your willingness to support our church in times like these our church desperately needs people like you we know that you re supporting the greek patriarchate of alexandria and we re grateful that you responded to our need and came to visit us may god reward you greatly it s a true pleasure gentlemen having you here who would like to start forgive me for interrupting um but before we start the conversation we would like to know where holy metropolitan nektarios is uh wasn t he condemned a and expelled by the patriarch sophronius shame on everyone who condemned him including patriarch sophronius where is he i don t think he s in athens where is he i believe that he took the position of a preacher in evia of a preacher what s going on i m sorry but we were informed about him by the representatives of your patriarchate we want our metropolitan nektarios to come back to us as our next patriarch before we proceed with any business we would like you to make clear to everyone that metropolitan nektarios is holy and just and that he was slandered we will do that let s send an urgent cable to the dioceses in evia mm hmm now elder daniel why are you walking ahead of the holy bishop nektarios he who is already included in our church s holy hierarchs keep your mind in hell and despair not no monastery for you not yet we achieved this despite the obstacles from alexandria they still cannot forget about me ah forget about them you re the best possible person to guide our young men into priesthood dear father sophronius i have officially become appointed director of the prestigious ecclesiastical rizarios school deep in my heart i believe that this news will make you glad as you always believed in me since i didn t get a chance to see you please permit me to ask in writing for your forgiveness for whatever offense i might have done i ask you to find it in your heart to forgive me whatever it may be i pray that you are well and that god grants you many years and i hope to see you again permit me to ask gentlemen where are the students performing the church services in the church not far from here unfortunately one cannot perform services here due to the condition of the chapel something needs to be done about this obviously your eminence but the funds are simply not available we will have to find a way this is an ecclesiastical school permit me to correct you your eminence this is not only an ecclesiastical school it is a regular high school as well and our primary focus is to provide our students with an excellent education i understand but if we attend to the chapel and make this place look more appealing we will attract more students who will be able to get an excellent education of course i just can t see how we can achieve something like that like i said the funds are extremely limited as a new director i will do my best to help with that i m happy to use my salary and some of my skills and i m sure that god will provide for the rest i speak from personal experience when i say that god will provide well that sounds fantastic please excuse me your eminence let me show you to your office this is kostas he will be assisting you with anything you might need nice to meet you kostas my

he insulted me no he insulted me he called me a turk did you say that no yes you did you call us names all the time you stole the book what book the one that is in your bag he gave me that book and asked me to read it i haven t stolen anything you liar i think i have heard enough i have no other choice but to punish myself yourself your eminence yes myself i will punish myself with a hunger strike please i would like you to instruct the cook not to send me food for three days are we clear yes your eminence go and please make amends with one another otherwise i will continue my punishment for a longer time jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner i heard you were looking for me why are the students being punished without my knowledge because we feel that you don t exercise enough authority i do implement punishments when i feel it is necessary a healthy balance between kindness and authority is best punishing yourself instead of the students when they misbehave is out of balance in my opinion it looks like your primary focus is to direct our students into priesthood not everyone is destined to become a priest we just came out of the dark ages 400 years of ottoman oppression and slavery education is vital for our development for the development of both clergy and laypeople i hope you understand that of course you are cultivating asceticism in our students and we all know that asceticism is a thing of the past it s dark age material i believe that you have a distorted view of what asceticism is mr president no i have a perfect view of what asceticism is it is a radical approach to religion it s long and long beards and painting this holy image outwardly of course a true ascetic does not worry about the outwardly appearance at all his main focus is to correct himself inwardly so he can get closer to god he s in effect a true christian are you a true christian i try to be your appointment at this school has not been filed with proper papers and the talk at the ministry says that you were expelled from egypt for moral reasons i was slandered of course you were did you request background check on me no your eminence we only asked for information in an official capacity so the patriarchal trust is bluntly informed the civil representative of the greek government that i was removed from my position because i was rebellious unethical and immoral mr riparis finishes the letter clearly stating that he believes you re a perfect cleric who was unjustly slandered but slander keeps following me doesn t it where are my accusers where are the witnesses where is the evidence of my crime on what grounds after four years of my unjust departure from egypt was this official accusation of me made an accusation that condemns me to immoral death what great wrong did i do against you your holiness why is there such a great wrath and pursuit against me seeking my total destruction the purpose of my outdated protest is to bring you to the knowledge of your holiness that your every rough against me is unjust may god be my witness and judge vassili leave the garden for me you mop the whole school already you need to rest i love this garden your eminence it makes this place look so beautiful if you continue doing my gardening i might have to take up some of your cleaning oh no don t even joke about that your eminence it is beneath you to clean toilets honest and hard work is not beneath anyone let s go and have some coffee you want to have coffee with me yes vassili i want to have coffee with you leave that here come on let s go i had to call this meeting gentlemen as a medical emergency concerning our student nicholas he has had fever for over two weeks his condition looks critical and even after doctors treatments it is not getting any better nor do the doctors have any idea what is wrong with him his illness seems to be of a mental nature therefore i suggest we transfer him to the sanatorium we need to inform his guardian right away we cannot do such a thing he needs to go to the hospital to be properly treated and diagnosed which is right across the street not some sanatorium far away from here after all he does have a fever he is here on a minimum tuition i doubt he can afford additional treatment of any kind we should pay for it it s the least that we can do for the child who has been studying here so diligently we can t bear such an expense your eminence he s here on a partial scholarship i think we already did more than doing the least we should inform his guardian immediately of our decision i will pay for it myself we ran all possible tests we don t know what s going on his health is falling apart i m sorry to say this but we re expecting the worst by tomorrow what is going on my son you are holding something heavy inside of you whatever it is know that god loves you and wants you to do great things god has forgotten about me why do you say that i studied hard so that i could come here and and help my father and my sisters but it was all for nothing my father has has killed himself and my step mother sent my sisters into servitude so you see god wants me to die let s see about that here kostas inform our students that we are going to do an all night prayer for the healing of nicholas father father nicholas woke up he asked for food god heard your prayers your eminence god heard our prayers look how beautiful they are justice and truth compel us to not only endorse the metropolitan of pentapolis but to affirm that his candidacy is among the strongest because he s one of the most distinguished well educated and irreproachable bishops that the eastern orthodox church has to offer kostas i read it i know you did i just need to point out what the most respected religious journalists think about you his character is such that if someone other than himself is chosen for the patriarchal throne he would be most pleased i d like to remain most pleased father do not say such things they wilt you i hope uh you are not avoiding your heavenly call to duty i am not avoiding anything and especially not the heavenly things i just prefer the simple people it seems that your time has come don t forget the ones who did not side with the slanderers we are praying you re elected justice will prevail this time your silence used to cut like a knife one word from you would have soothed my pain even a lie or a courtesy but nothing like i meant nothing to you at all did you really believe that i was a fraud that i wanted your seat or has the fear of losing your position blinded you to such an extent you used to call me your son remember i loved you like my father but some other things were more important to you than your son my beloved father sophronius justice will prevail today i will not be elected a patriarch thank you father how can you be happy you you should have been the patriarch and you know it everyone knows that let god s will be done kostas you are meant to do great things you don t have to be patriarch to do great things your eminence i need to talk to you your articles and your books are so full of wisdom and truth and what s more important people listen to what you have to say you know we have a serious problem with heretics in our city would you be able to write something to encourage people to stay with the orthodox tradition it would be my pleasure your eminence i need your help with this please can you make an effort to clear your status pardon me you need to clear your status with egypt they need to give you a dioceses i have done everything that i could to resolve my situation in egypt perhaps you could help me first you need to resolve the matter with the patriarchy of egypt you are considered a traveling hierarch because of your status meaning not a greek citizen i am still not considered greek you re a holy man your grace forgive me for bothering you you are not bothering me it is so good to be here there is so much light in your presence i mean not like anyone else would see it your eminence i lost my eyesight due to illness when i was very little my parents had to make a choice to let me get a certain vaccine and become blind or to let me die thank god they chose to let me live life is so beautiful your eminence i have been so fortunate and also to meet you and get your blessing what is your name xenia xenia thank you very much for your kind words thank you your eminence forgive me if i am being bold but is there any way i can speak to you again a few of my friends and i would like to become nuns could you help guide us it would be my pleasure to help you please come and see me at my office jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner so please tell me when did this idea about becoming nuns come about we have talked about it for a long time and we have all decided that we really want to do that your desire is indeed beautiful but are you aware that by becoming a nun you re accepting poverty and a very difficult life we are aware of it our life has not been easy we all grew up as orphans in extreme poverty hardships don t scare us as long as we can stay together only a few are chosen to take this path you must be truly ready and willing to go through it until the end we are your eminence is there a place where you would like to go have you visited any monasteries we visited quite a few but it s hard to find a place that will take all of us and we want to remain together so the best option would be to find a place where we can establish the convent thank you your eminence we will start searching immediately whose land is',\n","   'of mirze as your husband i do whoo hoo mm all right all right

together when men fight one another and the wife of one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who was beating him and seizes him by his private parts you should cut off her hand you shall not lie with a male as with a woman it is an abomination all verses from the old testament since perfected by christ s new law of love and forgiveness what is the value of outdated rituals and conventions of attitudes that condemn more people than they save i am imploring you imploring us to perfect our rules in the same way and to reaffirm our commitment to redemption to compassion to love and be a force for change in the law the country and ourselves i think it s admirable to demand change but a shepherd has to be conscious of how fast his flock can move too fast and some may fall behind too slow and we ll be left in the dark morning bishop mr george mr davenport thank you for sending me your speech but i m afraid you won t be speaking today attitudes to sexual morality are not on the agenda this year i have a right to speak they re taking their seats mr jones bishop i ll be making an appointment to visit your parish in the next day or two i ll need to take everything into account so it would be wise not to have any more half naked girls parading themselves when i visit that was my si how do you rules reputations that is all they care about if they don t wanna change then maybe i don t wanna be there anyway drink have you been listening it s a job will and sometimes jobs have rules that you don t agree with trust me i know there s a call a woman saying her husband attacked her where what a domestic send larry she asked for you specifically nice place so was mine from the outside sorry i ll be with you in a minute rita daltrey sorry sir i m just the maid is mrs daltrey all right no no no no dorie you need to ask me to disable it before you open the door mr daltrey poli apologies gentlemen um i just need to telephone your station it s connected directly dorie where s rita ah hello uh yes this is gene daltrey no false alarm i m afraid thank you rita what s happening here uh she uh tripped on the stairs hit her face on the banister is it bad i m still beautiful aren t i of course you are you re my sunny girl you always will be ah that ll be the doctor get that will you dorie mrs daltrey can you tell us in your own words how you received that injury it s as gene said but you told the operator you were being attacked must have been the bump on the head and possibly the gin and tonics thank you dorie oh not again i m sorry doctor so you re a singer yes the best in clubland the magic s in the production that s where my husband s talents are doctor do rita s injuries look consistent with a fall or something else perhaps a strike with a fist wh wh now hang on well it s a large bruise even contact so more likely a banister uh yes i d say so yes inspector uh vicar i understand how this looks and i appreciate your concern but please be assured it was an accident take these and rest we can t just leave her in there just give it a sec inspector your hat what really happened i didn t see nothing sir madam asked me to give you this what is it it s johnny s business card thanks for ringing this is exactly why i told her to ask for you how long s it been going on for will listen i appreciate your interest but rita s a client so i think it s better if i speak to geordie in private i know situations like this oh don t worry we ll nail the bastard i wish i could share your optimism been trying to nail gene daltrey for years there s not much i can do johnny if rita won t talk i ve been looking after her since she was singing in pubs beautiful voice but if she used it to speak out against him what would he get slap on the wrist at best so so she wants to get away she wants to leave him but she s scared he s got this alarm yeah we heard it it s got nothing to do with burglars it s all about keeping her in it s on a timer connected directly to here and if you could if you could find out what time goes on and off i could help her escape what he s got her trapped drunk drugged up until he needs another record why can t she give you the timings herself because she doesn t know em he changes them and then he won t tell her at least when we were prisoners we had each other geordie johnny afang soup it s full of vitamins or mutton pie full of gravy i m not hungry thanks what s this about you being thrown out the conference you just can t help yourself can you i told you not to use that line about private parts i think it has less to do with my speech than someone telling the bishop about tamara being here well wasn t me he s coming here in the next few days he wants me to reconsider my position it wasn t my intention to get anyone in trouble of course not judas iscariot morning let s arrest rita daltrey the rules are ridiculous so we may make them work for us arrest her for what making a false complaint at least then we can get her alone think we can move on from that case will there s a call from the same house as yesterday the maid s hysterical someone broke in last night they shot mr gene i woke up i came downstairs and found sir like this i woke madam and then telephoned doctor harvey i thought maybe he could be saved sadly not he s been dead for a few hours now but you didn t hear the gunshot no sir could ve used a silencer mrs daltrey rita i never really woke up from the pills harvey gave me last night you didn t hear the alarm either that started when i arrived so the intruder must ve got in before the alarm was put on last night what time did you go to bed dorie early around nine so between nine and when the alarm was put on which we can get from the station right boss uh right if there was an intruder of course there was it s a robbery weren t it daltrey s walked in on em well that s what it looks like what are you getting at vicar i m just saying that we should explore all possibilities at this stage that s what the inspector usually says geordie uh larry have a look around check all the access points your broken locks latches and maybe we should continue this conversation with mrs daltrey down at the police station it must be very difficult for her here with your solicitor present of course rita calls us yesterday because gene is attacking her and today he turns up dead that is some coincidence let s not jump to any conclusions hey i don t blame her we didn t help how s she doing well her husband s just been murdered how d you think any idea who did it well it looks like a burglary but uh thanks will she s johnny s client as you know i m sure they ll want some privacy actually it might be better to have a man of the cloth present now she s just lost her husband as you said she in here as i understand my client has outlined her movements last night and the sad discovery of her husband this morning and you ve invited her here to give a a further witness statement to the best of her knowledge yeah that s right yeah we re trying to establish exactly what happened to gene daltrey i told you i was asleep rita i can imagine you re experiencing some quite conflicting emotions primarily shock and anguish as anyone would feel having lost their spouse in such a violent and unexpected way of course but in light of your call to the police yesterday i don t see how that s relevant well um if mr daltrey did attack mrs daltrey i could fully understand if vicar are you saying that my client is now a suspect rather than a witness and didn t the call yesterday transpire to be nothing more than an accident you said yourself that rita had been a victim of abuse at the hands of mr daltrey that was off the record and not relevant to this case you said it was a burglary no i said it looked like a burglary then surely that is the angle you should be pursuing instead of making baseless allegations against a grieving widow gentlemen please my husband and i had our ups and downs like all couples i m sure and sometimes i wish i had fought back but the truth is i was never strong enough rita did you see that hmm she s a long time client the way he tried to railroad me so what look uh take rita home i ll talk to johnny sorry about that will but it s my job to protect my client isn t that right may i offer you a lift home yeah thank you my office now i m sorry you say you re sorry what the hell happened he just jumped out on me i got in through the back door i made it to the living room and there he was swinging at me like a madman so you shot him i had no choice you took a gun with you just just in case my old service revolver i didn t mean to do it it just happened it just happened what do you mean it just happened you got a drink hmm you got a drink top drawer didn t know what to do erm so i pulled out some drawers took a few trinkets to make it look like a robbery just to give us a get out us gene daltrey deserved everything he got what about rita she see you i didn t even make it as far as her before he jumped out on me she didn t know i was coming last night all right she would never have been able to keep it from him and you re sure she s just a client that s not why i did it christ you saw what he did to her i would ve wanted to help her regardless and so would you and you did we did you all right it s gonna feel different without him madam how are you would you get me a stiff drink please dorie i don t think that s a good idea rita you ve had a big shock to the system but i need something well i can help with that thank you vicar dorie might i have a quick word can we get these tested for what for sedatives i took samples of drinks from the daltrey house you what what if that s why rita and dorie were so tired last night because they were drugged by who the doctor we know he was giving this to rita and he knew about the alarm larry thanks will yeah that s good work yeah you er get anything out of johnny no look i know he is your friend and i m sorry if i ever fancy a drink i can t i should be getting on with this hello empire builder how was the trip fine except for the calluses on my back on my hip will did you see mrs chapman s note about the bishop coming tomorrow i guessed from the smell of polish i i wanted to apologise the bishop asked me to report back about the vicarage and i couldn t exactly lie could i clearly not you may have the luxury of bending the rules but i ve always been held to a higher standard including by myself so for that i can t apologise well maybe my luck s run out now too probably fair enough paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison was shaken and immediately all the doors opened and everyone s fetters were unfastened finch a word if you please bible group seems to be going well it s wonderful inspiring well it s not your concern anymore oh you ve found a new chaplain no but the prison board in their infinite wisdom have decided to reduce your sentence in the light of your help exposing the reverend mr byatt you must be delighted i am morning is uh is geordie in not yet larry have you got those test results back yet oh boss changed his mind said not to bother with em d you think geordie s been himself recently when was the last time he was late for work or didn t follow up leads will the other day when mrs daltrey s solicitor was here johnny inspector keating showed him these the daltrey alarm codes are we having a party no henry jones is henry i didn t think he had it in him neither does he he s had the nerve to be telling tales about will and now the bishop s coming to see us she knelt before him obscenity let s see what the bishop says when he sees what henry s been up to drinking smoking dirty books sylvia i know you re missing leonard but you can t frame henry i ve already lost my leonard i m not losing will too excuse me uh you re not supposed to be sleeping here oh good morning inspector didn t expect to find you here yeah that makes two of us is everything all right i know i m new to this but that s what i m here for curate to care all cure from the latin curatus is it work maybe marital strife i m fine thank you henry i ll leave you to it then shall i maybe i should find will for you wasn t with you then last night either i wouldn t worry he s uh probably just with johnny well that is what i m worried about why are you worried if i have to answer that you re not as good a vicar as i thought you were you re the one who came here so something is up you tell me i m just concerned he s making mistakes at work cause that s the most important thing what does that mean you saw the state of him on our anniversary you didn t come around here then did you i m sorry something happened i shouldn t be telling you this you re his friend i don t feel much like it at the moment cathy just a lover s tiff that s what my mother used to say well he didn t hit me he never has but he wanted to you don t ever raise your hands at cathy never touched her you shouldn t even come close what do you want to hit me now go on then fine i deserve it get off me i m not your father no you re not i expected better from you well that s your fault not mine i know you gave johnny the alarm timings did you know he was gonna kill daltrey of course not it was self defence but he s seeing rita let go it makes no difference you saw the state of her you want to be angry with me you should be pleased daltrey s dead that is not our decision to make whose is it his it s the laws like it was with leonard you said yourself rules laws nonsense no the law is who you are you have no idea who i am i know i will never understand what you and johnny went through but what is it you owe him geordie what s this it s a list of the men that died in our time at the prison of war camp it was the last man s job to tell the families what had happened to their boys i was the last man by the end of the war they knew they were losing the guards would take one of us out every couple of days it started with the sick those who couldn t work and they shot him say food not that we got much keep the rest of us on our toes but by the end we were all broken so there was no order rhyme nor reason they just picked someone until there was only two of us left you and johnny that last night i said i hope they pick me he said the same but when i rolled over to sleep that night you know what i did i prayed they d pick johnny instead of me can you imagine praying for your friend to die geordie and then in the morning he was gone and then there was a shot and then another and another the yanks had armed up the burmese and they liberated the camp when we got home i lost him after demob on purpose and i never saw him again until he turned up here you both survived well it doesn t matter i prayed for him to die i begged for it that s who i am i know it god knows it now no god heard your prayer for what it was fear desperation you didn t pray for johnny to die you prayed to live look what you ve built cathy the kids your job and you cannot throw that away not for anything i ll come with you we can talk to him together no whatever happens it s between me and johnny there he is daniel told me you didn t want to be seen with him very wise we don t want you going straight back in do we no he also told me that you felt you were lacking purpose well look no further it s sylvia she needs you or rather henry does the new curate she s taken against him whatever for he s too tidy too competent too perfect he s just not you you have to talk to her leonard she won t listen to anyone else there s some chocolate for you and dandelion and burdock oh can we just get going my knees are killing me have you found the boss not yet i got those drinks tested you were right they were spiked clean old barbital looks like the doctor was putting the whole house to sleep hey mate we in the clear my lord leonard mm mm mrs c i have heard some shocking allegations of bullying during my absence you should see what henry s done to your room and this is all henry i d know this shade anywhere he s a tell tale he s going to lose willie s job he doesn t even eat meat sidney was a drunk will rides a motorbike i ve been to prison you were very hard on us all and rightly so but you were always fair well mostly we both need to accept this isn t my room anymore but that doesn t mean i won t always love you i love you too i missed you so much hello mrs chapman you tidy up i ll stall him don t worry i haven t escaped the notorious leonard finch henry jones ooh hello boy oh i ve missed you too how d you get him to sit like that oh it just takes time and biscuits a bit like mrs c how are you finding it well the parish is lovely and the congregation seemed very nice but i don t think mrs chapman likes me very much which is a credit to you i m sure mrs c s a rite of passage we have similar things in prison you ll come out stronger and will i accidently got him in some trouble and will s more than capable of getting himself into trouble but only because he wants to be out there saving souls lives helping the police he s the kind of vicar i d have liked to have been maybe you will be too single malt hmm i m all right i usually get a suite but i don t suppose it d be a couple of nights i bumped into you and rita you re sure only the best can t let you get away with it i ll help you we ll tell them the truth that you were protecting rita that it was self defence it will be manslaughter not murder geordie come on gene daltrey was a bully he had it coming i can t lie for you after everything we went through together in that well you can t let me go you like to go back then all right didn t you when we get out it s what you used to say you remember when we get out of this we re gonna go away for a weekend chicken dinners dancing drinking you kept me going and then you were gone i couldn t do it what i couldn t face you because i prayed for you to die i m sorry i d have gone for you i really would is dr harvey here doctor dorie do you see much of him and johnny together meet a solicitor we think they drugged you that s why you and rita was so tired the night of the murder excuse me i prescribed those pills solely and legitimately for mrs daltrey she s she s been very agitated hurting herself mr gene never touched her he loved her protected her maybe too much sometimes he didn t want anyone to know how bad it was those drinks you put down the other day they weren t yours and rita s they are mine and mr genes so rita wasn t the one sedated where is she hello my love it s all right geordie understands he knows that i did it to protect you inspector i wanted to thank you for intervening when you did and for taking a chance to help us i don t know what i would have done without you both johnny tells me you have a beautiful family yeah we we just want what you ve got where is geordie he s not here hey you you all right i know the truth oh give it up will he s not sending us down you don t owe him anything what and he does you no he owes himself who even is he to you hey you want him to put in a good word for you is that it ask him upstairs to take back your prayers we ve been through this so have we when people are trapped in awful situations they do the things they have to what does he know that s what you d have us believe isn t it rita geordie did what he had to and then he came back home and he turned that awfulness into something good a job a family a life and it takes strength and courage more than and stealing money or killing a man ever could what do you mean gene never touched you did he but you drugged and killed him let me guess she had you write gene s will she saw the pain you were in and told you the story you wanted to hear she is using you johnny just like you re using geordie i love you they re just words from a song you don t get to stand on stage as long as i have without getting to know what men want i made gene that money and he was never going to let me go like you say people do what they have to when they re trapped rita just let them go will no will fine rita daltrey i m arresting you for the murder of gene daltrey i knew you never had it in you johnny richards i m arresting you for conspiracy to cover up a murder not too tight eh it won t be for long it will be all right johnny i ll make sure they take into account that you saved will you ll get three meals a day blankets clean water i ll see you then geordie say a prayer for me will ya another sandwich my lord where did you say he went urgent police business i believe i m so sorry bishop it s too late for that this is exactly the kind of dereliction i ve come to expect from you disrespect disobedience without even the common courtesy to arrive on time to defend your job bishop if i may be so bold i think it s important we don t mistake my naivety for mr davenport s negligence what i mistook for distraction from work was actually the fight against injustice i misread the rescue for fallen woman for one to lust i like to see myself as a practical clergyman and i m very much looking forward to learning from will in the months and years to come well actually i think there s a lot i could learn from henry too about temperance decorum and of course punctuality lardy cake so where to now then marrakesh paris bognor how about a cup of tea and a cinnamon bun at your place you all right what s that no cathy hey listen i know things haven t been right recently i want some time apart how long we ll see cathy please i ll be better i ll tell the kids it s just for now dear god it s been a while i don t really remember how this works but hopefully you still forgive i m hoping you can make me a better man to my family to my friends and to you amen mind if i join you it s your boss i ve got will davenport on line two sir he says he ll meet us at the pub you all right no but at least i know it now will i do not think any less of you for not serving in fact i m glad you didn t because you can see the world as it ought to be the only reason i didn t have to is because of men like you and johnny i m going to get her back you know cathy i know i ll help what with your track record i ll take my own chances please rate this subtitle at www osdb link
